The exact mechanism of ethanol-associated carcinogenesis has remained unknown. The metabolism of ethanol leads to generation of acetaldehyde (AA), which is highly toxic and carcinogenic. The amount of acetaldehyde to which cells or tissues are exposed after alcohol ingestion may be of great importance and may, among others, affects carcinogenesis. Ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The enzyme responsible for oxidation of acetaldehyde is aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Both formation and degradation of acetaldehyde depends on the activity of these enzymes. The total alcohol dehydrogenase activity is significantly higher in cancer tissues than in this healthy organs (e.g. liver, stomach, esophagus, colorectum). Moreover the activity of ADH is much higher than the activity of ALDH. This suggests that cancer cells have a greater capability for ethanol oxidation but less ability to remove acetaldehyde than normal tissues. In addition significant differences of ADH isoenzymes activities between cancer tissues and healthy organs may be a factor intensifying carcinogenesis by the increased ability to acetaldehyde formation from ethanol and disorders in metabolism of some biologically important substances (e.g. retinoic acid). The changes in activity of particular ADH isoenzymes in the sera of patients with different cancers, seem to be caused by release of these isoenzymes from cancer cells, and may be useful for diagnostics of this cancer. The particular isoenzymes of ADH present in the serum may indicate the cancer localization.","['(2E)-4-hydroxynon-2-enal', 'NADH', 'H+']","['(2E)-non-2-ene-1,4-diol', 'NAD+']","['CCCCCC(/C=C/C=O)O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']","['CCCCCC(/C=C/CO)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

The isozymes exhibited widely divergent kinetic characteristics. A2 exhibited a Km value for ethanol of 0.15 mM and a broad substrate specificity, with Km values decreasing dramatically with an increase in chain length; C2 also exhibited this broad specificity for alcohols but showed a Km value of 232 mM for ethanol. These isozymes also showed broad substrate specificities as aldehyde reductases. In contrast, B2 showed no detectable activity as an aldehyde reductase for the aldehydes examined, and used ethanol as substrate only at very high concentrations (greater than 0.5 M). The isozyme exhibited low Km and high Vmax values, however, with medium-chain alcohols. Immunological studies showed that A2 was immunologically distinct from the B2 and C2 isozymes. In vitro molecular hybridization studies gave no evidence for association between the alcohol dehydrogenase subunits. The results confirm genetic analyses [Holmes, Albanese, Whitehead and Duley (1981) J. Exp. Zool. 215, 151-157] which are consistent with at least three structural genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase in the mouse and confirm the role of the major liver isozyme (A2) in ethanol metabolism.","['(E)-hex-2-en-1-ol', 'NAD+']","['(E)-hex-2-en-1-one', 'NADH']","['CCC/C=C/CO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCC/C=C/C=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

The Trp95Leu mutant displays no apparent activity with short-chain primary and secondary alcohols and poor activity with aromatic substrates and coenzyme. Moreover, the Trp --> Leu substitution affects the structural stability of the archaeal ADH, decreasing its thermal stability without relevant changes in secondary structure. The double mutant Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr was also purified to assist in crystallographic analysis. This mutant exhibits higher activity but decreased affinity toward aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes as well as NAD(+) and NADH compared to the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structure of the Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr mutant apo form, determined at 2.0 A resolution, reveals a large local rearrangement of the substrate site with dramatic consequences. The Leu95 side-chain conformation points away from the catalytic metal center and the widening of the substrate site is partially counteracted by a concomitant change of Trp117 side chain conformation.

On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4.

The Trp95Leu mutant displays no apparent activity with short-chain primary and secondary alcohols and poor activity with aromatic substrates and coenzyme. Moreover, the Trp --> Leu substitution affects the structural stability of the archaeal ADH, decreasing its thermal stability without relevant changes in secondary structure. The double mutant Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr was also purified to assist in crystallographic analysis. This mutant exhibits higher activity but decreased affinity toward aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes as well as NAD(+) and NADH compared to the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structure of the Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr mutant apo form, determined at 2.0 A resolution, reveals a large local rearrangement of the substrate site with dramatic consequences. The Leu95 side-chain conformation points away from the catalytic metal center and the widening of the substrate site is partially counteracted by a concomitant change of Trp117 side chain conformation.

This mutant exhibits higher activity but decreased affinity toward aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes as well as NAD(+) and NADH compared to the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structure of the Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr mutant apo form, determined at 2.0 A resolution, reveals a large local rearrangement of the substrate site with dramatic consequences. The Leu95 side-chain conformation points away from the catalytic metal center and the widening of the substrate site is partially counteracted by a concomitant change of Trp117 side chain conformation. Structural changes at the active site are consistent with the reduced activity on substrates and decreased coenzyme binding.","['(S)-2-butanol', 'NAD+']","['2-butanone', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CC[C@H](C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

This zone was located on the cathode side of the origin. Incubation of D. lebanonensis Adh with NAD+ and acetone altered the electrophoretic pattern to more anodal migrating zones. D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting. Pyrazole was an ethanol-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The difference spectra of the enzyme-NAD+-pyrazole complex gave an absorption peak at 305 nm with epsilon 305 14.5 X 10(3) M-1 X cm-1. Concentrations and amounts of active enzyme can thus be determined. A kinetic rate assay to determine the concentration of enzyme active sites is also presented. This has been developed from active site concentrations established by titration at 305 nm of the enzyme and pyrazole with NAD+. In contrast with the amino acid composition, which indicated that D. lebanonensis Adh and the D. melanogaster alleloenzymes were not closely related, the enzymological studies showed that their active sites were similar although differing markedly from those of zinc alcohol dehydrogenases.","['(S)-2-methylbutan-1-ol', 'NAD+']","['(S)-2-methyl-butanal', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CC[C@H](C)CO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC[C@H](C)C=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors. In this regard, the interactions of substrate molecules with the protein moiety are dominant over the interactions with the catalytic metal ion.","['(S)-2-pentanol', 'NAD+']","['2-pentanone', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CCC[C@H](C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCCC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

The Trp95Leu mutant displays no apparent activity with short-chain primary and secondary alcohols and poor activity with aromatic substrates and coenzyme. Moreover, the Trp --> Leu substitution affects the structural stability of the archaeal ADH, decreasing its thermal stability without relevant changes in secondary structure. The double mutant Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr was also purified to assist in crystallographic analysis. This mutant exhibits higher activity but decreased affinity toward aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes as well as NAD(+) and NADH compared to the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structure of the Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr mutant apo form, determined at 2.0 A resolution, reveals a large local rearrangement of the substrate site with dramatic consequences. The Leu95 side-chain conformation points away from the catalytic metal center and the widening of the substrate site is partially counteracted by a concomitant change of Trp117 side chain conformation.

The enzyme corresponding to the reaction was purified homogeneity, characterized and designated Leifsonia alcohol dehydrogenase (LSADH).

TADH is a NAD(H)-dependent enzyme and shows a very broad substrate spectrum producing exclusively the (S)-enantiomer in high enantiomeric excess (>99%) during asymmetric reduction of ketones. TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid.

Due to their versatile specificities, these biocatalysts are of great interest for industrial applications. The adh3-gene encoding a group III alcohol dehydrogenase was isolated from the gram-positive bacterium Oenococcus oeni and was characterised after expression in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Adh3 has been identified by genome BLASTP analyses using the amino acid sequence of 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase DhaT from Klebsiella pneumoniae and group III alcohol dehydrogenases with known activity towards 1,3-propanediol as target sequences. The recombinant protein was purified in a two-step column chromatography approach. Crystal structure determination and biochemical characterisation confirmed that Adh3 forms a Ni(2+)-containing homodimer in its active form. Adh3 catalyses the interconversion of ethanol and its corresponding aldehyde acetaldyhyde and is also capable of using other alcoholic compounds as substrates, such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol and 1-propanol. In the presence of Ni(2+), activity increases towards 1,3-propanediol and 1,2-propanediol. Adh3 is strictly dependent on NAD(+)/NADH, whereas no activity has been observed with NADP(+)/NADPH as co-factor. The enzyme exhibits a specific activity of 1.1 U/mg using EtOH as substrate with an optimal pH value of 9.0 for ethanol oxidation and 8.0 for aldehyde reduction. Moreover, Adh3 exhibits tolerance to several metal ions and organic solvents, but is completely inhibited in the presence of Zn(2+).

The HpADH3 displayed substrate specificities with clear preferences for medium chain length primary alcohols and acetaldehyde for an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction, respectively. Although the H. polymorpha ADH3 gene was induced by ethanol in the culture medium, both an ADH isozyme pattern analysis and an ADH activity assay indicated that HpADH3 is not the major ADH in H. polymorpha DL-1. Moreover, HpADH3 deletion did not affect the cell growth on different carbon sources. However, when the HpADH3 mutant was complemented by an HpADH3 expression cassette fused to a strong constitutive promoter, the resulting strain produced a significantly increased amount of ethanol compared to the wild-type strain in a glucose medium. In contrast, in a xylose medium, the ethanol production was dramatically reduced in an HpADH3 overproduction strain compared to that in the wild-type strain.

TADH is a NAD(H)-dependent enzyme and shows a very broad substrate spectrum producing exclusively the (S)-enantiomer in high enantiomeric excess (>99%) during asymmetric reduction of ketones. TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid.

The Trp95Leu mutant displays no apparent activity with short-chain primary and secondary alcohols and poor activity with aromatic substrates and coenzyme. Moreover, the Trp --> Leu substitution affects the structural stability of the archaeal ADH, decreasing its thermal stability without relevant changes in secondary structure. The double mutant Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr was also purified to assist in crystallographic analysis. This mutant exhibits higher activity but decreased affinity toward aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes as well as NAD(+) and NADH compared to the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structure of the Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr mutant apo form, determined at 2.0 A resolution, reveals a large local rearrangement of the substrate site with dramatic consequences. The Leu95 side-chain conformation points away from the catalytic metal center and the widening of the substrate site is partially counteracted by a concomitant change of Trp117 side chain conformation.

ATN1 (TADH) was characterized biochemically with respect to its potential as a biocatalyst for organic synthesis. TADH is a NAD(H)-dependent enzyme and shows a very broad substrate spectrum producing exclusively the (S)-enantiomer in high enantiomeric excess (>99%) during asymmetric reduction of ketones. TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid. When applying cofactor regeneration at high pH, however, the ratio of acid to alcohol could be changed, and full conversion to the carboxylic acid was achieved.","['1-hexanol', 'NAD+']","['hexanal', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CCCCCCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCCCCC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

TADH is a NAD(H)-dependent enzyme and shows a very broad substrate spectrum producing exclusively the (S)-enantiomer in high enantiomeric excess (>99%) during asymmetric reduction of ketones. TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid.

Although the H. polymorpha ADH3 gene was induced by ethanol in the culture medium, both an ADH isozyme pattern analysis and an ADH activity assay indicated that HpADH3 is not the major ADH in H. polymorpha DL-1. Moreover, HpADH3 deletion did not affect the cell growth on different carbon sources. However, when the HpADH3 mutant was complemented by an HpADH3 expression cassette fused to a strong constitutive promoter, the resulting strain produced a significantly increased amount of ethanol compared to the wild-type strain in a glucose medium. In contrast, in a xylose medium, the ethanol production was dramatically reduced in an HpADH3 overproduction strain compared to that in the wild-type strain.

Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated.

We previously showed that co-administration of ethanol or 4-methylpyrazole strongly enhances DNA adduct formation by 1-hydroxymethylpyrene, indicating an involvement of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in the detoxification. This mechanism may be involved in the observed synergism of smoking and alcohol consumption in certain human cancers. In a preceding study, cDNA-expressed human ADH2 efficiently oxidised 1-, 2- and 4-hydroxymethylpyrene; these reactions were inhibited in the presence of ethanol or 4-methylpyrazole. Here we report that ADH1C, ADH3 and ADH4 also show substantial activity towards these substrates and two further congeners, 1-hydroxymethyl-6-methylpyrene and 1-hydroxymethyl-8-methylpyrene. All four ADH forms also catalysed the reverse reaction, implying that the aldehydes have to be sequestered by other enzymes, such as aldehyde dehydrogenases, for final detoxification. ADH1C and ADH4 activities towards hydroxymethylpyrenes were more strongly inhibited in the presence of ethanol and 4-methylpyrazole than those of ADH2. ADH3 was only inhibited at very high concentrations of the modulators. In conclusions, several human ADHs are capable of detoxifying benzylic alcohols of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

The pI value of the enzyme and its optimum pH for the oxidation reaction were determined to be 6.7 and 7.0, respectively. The enzyme contains 2 gram-atoms Zn per subunit. The enzyme exclusively requires NAD(+) as a coenzyme and shows the pro-R stereospecificity for hydrogen transfer at the C4 position of the nicotinamide moiety of NAD(+). F. frigidimaris KUC-1 alcohol dehydrogenase shows as high thermal stability as the enzymes from thermophilic microorganisms. The enzyme is active at 0 to over 85 degrees C and the most active at 70 degrees C. The half-life time and k (cat) value at 60 degrees C were calculated to be 50 min and 27,400 min(-1), respectively. The enzyme also shows high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures (0-20 degrees C) (k(cat)/K(m) at 10 degrees C; 12,600 mM(-1)min(-1)) similar to other cold-active enzymes from psychrophiles.

The HpADH3 displayed substrate specificities with clear preferences for medium chain length primary alcohols and acetaldehyde for an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction, respectively. Although the H. polymorpha ADH3 gene was induced by ethanol in the culture medium, both an ADH isozyme pattern analysis and an ADH activity assay indicated that HpADH3 is not the major ADH in H. polymorpha DL-1. Moreover, HpADH3 deletion did not affect the cell growth on different carbon sources. However, when the HpADH3 mutant was complemented by an HpADH3 expression cassette fused to a strong constitutive promoter, the resulting strain produced a significantly increased amount of ethanol compared to the wild-type strain in a glucose medium. In contrast, in a xylose medium, the ethanol production was dramatically reduced in an HpADH3 overproduction strain compared to that in the wild-type strain.

NAD+ in micromolar concentration protects the enzyme against the inhibitor in an uncompetitive manner, while imidazole significantly increases the extent of the activation. Carboxymethylation selectively modifies one out of five cysteine residues per subunit, namely, Cys 38, located in the catalytic site, as determined by peptide and sequence analysis, and enhances by up to 25-fold the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Carboxymethylated SsADH is less thermostable and shows a temperature optimum 30 degrees C lower than that of the native enzyme.

The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 are 60- and 200-fold higher, respectively, compared to the native enzyme. The significant isotope effect in alcohol oxidation suggests that hydride transfer partially limits the turnover rate of the reaction catalyzed by the modified enzyme, whereas the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme is NADH dissociation.

The oxidation rate of aliphatic alcohols and the reduction rate of aromatic aldehydes were also higher. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 were 3 orders of magnitude greater compared to those of the wild type enzyme. It is thought that the higher turnover of the mutant SsADH is due to the faster dissociation of the modified enzyme-coenzyme complex. Spectroscopic studies showed no relevant changes in either secondary or tertiary structure, while analysis with fluorescent probes revealed a significant increase in surface hydrophobicity for the mutant, with respect to that of the wild type molecule. The mutant SsADH displays improved thermal stability, as indicated by the increase in Tm from 90 to 93 degrees C, which was determined by the apparent transition curves. Kinetic thermal stability studies at pH 9.0 for mutant SsADH showed a marked increase in activation enthalpy compensated by an entropy gain, which resulted in a higher activation barrier against thermal unfolding of the enzyme. Ammonia analysis showed that the Asn249Tyr substitution produced the effect of markedly reducing the extent of deamidation during thermoinactivation, thus suggesting that Asn249 plays a significant role in the mechanism of irreversible thermal denaturation of the archaeal ADH. Furthermore, the decrease in the activating effect by moderate concentrations of denaturants and studies with proteases and chelating agents point to an increase in structural rigidity and a tightening of structural zinc as additional factors responsible for the improved thermal resistance of the mutant enzyme.","['1-propanol', 'NAD+']","['propanal', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CCCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

The 373-amino acid sigma-ADH encoded by this cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme for ethanol oxidation at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, calculated from active-site titration of NADH binding, was 92 +/- 9 units/mg. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site. The deletion of Gly-117 in human sigma-ADH and a substitution of Leu for the bulky Tyr-110 appear to facilitate retinol access to the active-site zinc.","['12-hydroxydodecanoate', 'NAD+']","['12-oxododecanoic acid', 'NADH']","['C(CCCCCC(=O)[O-])CCCCCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['C(CCCCCC(=O)O)CCCCC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

Recombinant BsADH was produced in Escherichia coli as a homogeneous tetrameric enzyme and showed high activity towards the industrially relevant substrate ω-hydroxy lauric acid methyl ester (HLAMe) with K M = 86 μM and 44 U mg(-1). The equilibrium constant for HLAMe oxidation to the aldehyde (OLAMe) with NAD(+) was determined as 2.16 × 10(-3) from the kinetic parameters of the BsADH-catalyzed forward and reverse reactions. Since BsADH displayed limited stability under oxidizing conditions, the predominant oxidation-prone residue Cys257 was mutated to Leu based on sequence homology with related enzymes and computational simulation. This substitution resulted in an improved BsADH variant exhibiting prolonged stability and an elevated inactivation temperature. Semi-preparative biocatalysis at 60 °C using the stabilized enzyme, employing butyraldehyde for in situ cofactor regeneration with only catalytic amounts of NAD(+), yielded up to 23 % conversion of HLAMe to OLAMe after 30 min. In contrast to other oxidoreductases, no overoxidation to the dodecanoic diacid monomethyl ester was detected. Thus, the mutated BsADH offers a promising biocatalyst for the selective oxidation of fatty alcohols to yield intermediates for industrial polymer production.

The R-2-chloro-3-(imidazol-5-yl)propionate enantiomer did not inactivate the enzyme, and the reaction is thus enantioselective. Inactivation follows an affinity-labelling mechanism where a reversible complex is formed before the irreversible alkylation and inactivation of the enzyme. A reversible complex is also formed with the non-inactivating enantiomer, and this shows that the selectivity occurs at the irreversible step. By using a computer-controlled display system, models of the two enantiomers of 2-chloro- and 2-bromo-3-(imidazol-5-yl)propionate were built into a model of the enzyme so that the imidazole moiety was liganded to the active-site metal, while the carboxylate group interacted with the general anion-binding site. The conformation of the imidazole derivatives and their orientation in the active site were adjusted to minimize unfavourable steric interactions. It was clear that alkylation of cysteine-46 could proceed with the S-enantiomer bound in this way, but not with the R-enantiomer.

Values of Km and kcat for all the isoenzymes, except beta 1 beta 1-ADH, were similar for the oxidation of ethanol but varied markedly for other alcohols. The kcat values for beta 1 beta 1-ADH were invariant (approximately 10 min-1) and much lower (5-15-fold) than those for any other class I isoenzyme studied. Km values for methanol and ethylene glycol were from 5- to 100-fold greater than those for ethanol, depending on the isoenzyme, while those for benzyl alcohol, octanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were usually 100-1000-fold lower than those for ethanol. The homodimer beta 1 beta 1 had the lowest kcat/Km value for all alcohols studied except methanol and ethylene glycol; kcat values were relatively constant for all isoenzymes acting on all alcohols, and, hence, specificity was manifested principally in the value of Km. Values of Km and kcat/Km revealed for all enzymes examined that the short chain alcohols are the poorest while alcohols with bulky substituents are much better substrates. The experimental values of the kinetic parameters for heterodimers deviate from the calculated average of those of their parent homodimers and, hence, cannot be predicted from the behavior of the latter. Thus, the specificities of both the hetero- and homodimeric isoenzymes of ADH toward a given substrate are characteristics of each. Ethanol proved to be one of the ""poorest"" substrates examined for all class I isoenzymes which are the predominant forms of the human enzyme.

In addition, isopropanol, which has been used successfully as cosubstrate in cofactor regeneration, is oxidized as well by AdhA. Besides being thermostable (t (1/2) = 42 min at 70 degrees C), AdhA is also active in the presence of increased concentrations of urea (up to 5 M) and in the presence of organic solvents [up to 50% (v/v)] commonly used for organic synthesis.","['2,3-butanediol', 'H2O']",['?'],"['CC(C(C)O)O', 'O']",[]

Pre-steady-state kinetics with AdhD and the new mutants show a rich conformational behavior that is independent of the canonical arginine or the 2'-phosphate. Additionally, experiments with the highly active double mutant using NADPH as a cofactor demonstrate an unprecedented transient behavior where the binding mechanism appears to be dependent on cofactor concentration.

PTO 0846, encoding AdhA, consists of 954 bp corresponding to 317 aa. Sequence comparison revealed that the novel biocatalyst has a low sequence identity (<26%) to previously characterized enzymes. The recombinant alcohol dehydrogenase was purified using hydroxyapatite, and alcohol oxidative activity of the purified AdhA was measured over a wide pH and temperature range with maximal activity at 83 degrees C and pH 7.8. Detailed analysis suggests that the active AdhA is a multimer, consisting of 12 identical subunits, with a molecular mass of 35 kDa each. AdhA represents the first dodecameric alcohol dehydrogenase characterized until to date. AdhA is able to oxidize primary and secondary alcohols with ethanol and 1-phenylalcohol as preferred substrates and NAD(+) as preferred cofactor. In addition, isopropanol, which has been used successfully as cosubstrate in cofactor regeneration, is oxidized as well by AdhA. Besides being thermostable (t (1/2) = 42 min at 70 degrees C), AdhA is also active in the presence of increased concentrations of urea (up to 5 M) and in the presence of organic solvents [up to 50% (v/v)] commonly used for organic synthesis.","['2-aminoethanol', 'NAD+']",['?'],"['C(CO)N', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']",[]

RNA hybridization analysis revealed that adhA transcription was not only induced by these two substrates, but it was also subject to glucose catabolite repression. Accordingly, both induction of AdhA activity and ethanol utilization were detected only after depletion of glucose.

TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated.

However, oxidation of the intermediate alcohols to carboxylic acids is an important competing pathway leading to detoxification. We previously showed that co-administration of ethanol or 4-methylpyrazole strongly enhances DNA adduct formation by 1-hydroxymethylpyrene, indicating an involvement of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in the detoxification. This mechanism may be involved in the observed synergism of smoking and alcohol consumption in certain human cancers. In a preceding study, cDNA-expressed human ADH2 efficiently oxidised 1-, 2- and 4-hydroxymethylpyrene; these reactions were inhibited in the presence of ethanol or 4-methylpyrazole. Here we report that ADH1C, ADH3 and ADH4 also show substantial activity towards these substrates and two further congeners, 1-hydroxymethyl-6-methylpyrene and 1-hydroxymethyl-8-methylpyrene. All four ADH forms also catalysed the reverse reaction, implying that the aldehydes have to be sequestered by other enzymes, such as aldehyde dehydrogenases, for final detoxification. ADH1C and ADH4 activities towards hydroxymethylpyrenes were more strongly inhibited in the presence of ethanol and 4-methylpyrazole than those of ADH2. ADH3 was only inhibited at very high concentrations of the modulators. In conclusions, several human ADHs are capable of detoxifying benzylic alcohols of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Due to their versatile specificities, these biocatalysts are of great interest for industrial applications. The adh3-gene encoding a group III alcohol dehydrogenase was isolated from the gram-positive bacterium Oenococcus oeni and was characterised after expression in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Adh3 has been identified by genome BLASTP analyses using the amino acid sequence of 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase DhaT from Klebsiella pneumoniae and group III alcohol dehydrogenases with known activity towards 1,3-propanediol as target sequences. The recombinant protein was purified in a two-step column chromatography approach. Crystal structure determination and biochemical characterisation confirmed that Adh3 forms a Ni(2+)-containing homodimer in its active form. Adh3 catalyses the interconversion of ethanol and its corresponding aldehyde acetaldyhyde and is also capable of using other alcoholic compounds as substrates, such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol and 1-propanol. In the presence of Ni(2+), activity increases towards 1,3-propanediol and 1,2-propanediol. Adh3 is strictly dependent on NAD(+)/NADH, whereas no activity has been observed with NADP(+)/NADPH as co-factor. The enzyme exhibits a specific activity of 1.1 U/mg using EtOH as substrate with an optimal pH value of 9.0 for ethanol oxidation and 8.0 for aldehyde reduction. Moreover, Adh3 exhibits tolerance to several metal ions and organic solvents, but is completely inhibited in the presence of Zn(2+).

The HpADH3 displayed substrate specificities with clear preferences for medium chain length primary alcohols and acetaldehyde for an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction, respectively. Although the H. polymorpha ADH3 gene was induced by ethanol in the culture medium, both an ADH isozyme pattern analysis and an ADH activity assay indicated that HpADH3 is not the major ADH in H. polymorpha DL-1. Moreover, HpADH3 deletion did not affect the cell growth on different carbon sources. However, when the HpADH3 mutant was complemented by an HpADH3 expression cassette fused to a strong constitutive promoter, the resulting strain produced a significantly increased amount of ethanol compared to the wild-type strain in a glucose medium. In contrast, in a xylose medium, the ethanol production was dramatically reduced in an HpADH3 overproduction strain compared to that in the wild-type strain.

D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site.

For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1.

This zone was located on the cathode side of the origin. Incubation of D. lebanonensis Adh with NAD+ and acetone altered the electrophoretic pattern to more anodal migrating zones. D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting. Pyrazole was an ethanol-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The difference spectra of the enzyme-NAD+-pyrazole complex gave an absorption peak at 305 nm with epsilon 305 14.5 X 10(3) M-1 X cm-1. Concentrations and amounts of active enzyme can thus be determined. A kinetic rate assay to determine the concentration of enzyme active sites is also presented. This has been developed from active site concentrations established by titration at 305 nm of the enzyme and pyrazole with NAD+. In contrast with the amino acid composition, which indicated that D. lebanonensis Adh and the D. melanogaster alleloenzymes were not closely related, the enzymological studies showed that their active sites were similar although differing markedly from those of zinc alcohol dehydrogenases.","['2-methylpropan-1-ol', 'NAD+']","['2-methyl-propan-1-one', 'NADH']","['CC(C)CO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC(C)C=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

Two highly divergent ADH genes (15% identity at the amino acid level) of Cantaloupe Charentais melon (Cucumis melo var. Cantalupensis) have been isolated. Cm-ADH1 belongs to the medium-chain zinc-binding type of ADHs and is highly similar to all ADH genes expressed in fruit isolated so far. Cm-ADH2 belongs to the short-chain type of ADHs. The two encoded proteins are enzymatically active upon expression in yeast. Cm-ADH1 has strong preference for NAPDH as a co-factor, whereas Cm-ADH2 preferentially uses NADH. Both Cm-ADH proteins are much more active as reductases with K (m)s 10-20 times lower for the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols than for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes. They both show strong preference for aliphatic aldehydes but Cm-ADH1 is capable of reducing branched aldehydes such as 3-methylbutyraldehyde, whereas Cm-ADH2 cannot. Both Cm-ADH genes are expressed specifically in fruit and up-regulated during ripening. Gene expression as well as total ADH activity are strongly inhibited in antisense ACC oxidase melons and in melon fruit treated with the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), indicating a positive regulation by ethylene.

The amino acid sequence of HpADH3 shares over 70% of its identity with the alcohol dehydrogenases of other yeasts and exhibits the highest similarity of 91% with the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 of H. polymorpha. However, unlike the cytosolic HpADH1, HpADH3 appears to be a mitochondrial enzyme, as a mitochondrial targeting extension exists at its N terminus. The recombinant HpADH3 overexpressed in Escherichia coli showed similar catalytic efficiencies for ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction. The HpADH3 displayed substrate specificities with clear preferences for medium chain length primary alcohols and acetaldehyde for an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction, respectively. Although the H. polymorpha ADH3 gene was induced by ethanol in the culture medium, both an ADH isozyme pattern analysis and an ADH activity assay indicated that HpADH3 is not the major ADH in H. polymorpha DL-1. Moreover, HpADH3 deletion did not affect the cell growth on different carbon sources. However, when the HpADH3 mutant was complemented by an HpADH3 expression cassette fused to a strong constitutive promoter, the resulting strain produced a significantly increased amount of ethanol compared to the wild-type strain in a glucose medium. In contrast, in a xylose medium, the ethanol production was dramatically reduced in an HpADH3 overproduction strain compared to that in the wild-type strain. Taken together, our results suggest that the expression of HpADH3 would be an ideal engineering target to develop H. polymorpha as a substrate specific bioethanol production strain.","['2-octanol', 'NAD+']","['2-octanone', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CCCCCCC(C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCCCCCC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

TADH is a NAD(H)-dependent enzyme and shows a very broad substrate spectrum producing exclusively the (S)-enantiomer in high enantiomeric excess (>99%) during asymmetric reduction of ketones. TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid.

The amino acid sequence of HpADH3 shares over 70% of its identity with the alcohol dehydrogenases of other yeasts and exhibits the highest similarity of 91% with the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 of H. polymorpha. However, unlike the cytosolic HpADH1, HpADH3 appears to be a mitochondrial enzyme, as a mitochondrial targeting extension exists at its N terminus. The recombinant HpADH3 overexpressed in Escherichia coli showed similar catalytic efficiencies for ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction. The HpADH3 displayed substrate specificities with clear preferences for medium chain length primary alcohols and acetaldehyde for an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction, respectively. Although the H. polymorpha ADH3 gene was induced by ethanol in the culture medium, both an ADH isozyme pattern analysis and an ADH activity assay indicated that HpADH3 is not the major ADH in H. polymorpha DL-1. Moreover, HpADH3 deletion did not affect the cell growth on different carbon sources. However, when the HpADH3 mutant was complemented by an HpADH3 expression cassette fused to a strong constitutive promoter, the resulting strain produced a significantly increased amount of ethanol compared to the wild-type strain in a glucose medium. In contrast, in a xylose medium, the ethanol production was dramatically reduced in an HpADH3 overproduction strain compared to that in the wild-type strain.

A combined evaluation of steady-state kinetic data and rate constants obtained from stopped-flow measurements, allowed the determination of all rate constants of the following ordered bi-bi mechanism: E in equilibrium E.NAD in equilibrium E.NAD.R1R2 CHOH in equilibrium E.NADH.R1R2CO in equilibrium E.NADH in equilibrium E. 3. On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4. The observed enantioselectivity implies the existence of two productive ternary complexes; E.NADH.(pro-S) 2-butanone and E.NADH.(pro-R) 2-butanone. All rate constants describing the kinetic pathways of the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone have been determined. These data have been used to estimate the expected enantiomer product composition of 2-butanone reductions using apparent kcat/Km values for the two different ternary-complex configurations of 2-butanone. Additionally, these data have been used for computer simulations of the corresponding reaction cycles. Calculated, simulated and experimental data were found to be in good agreement. Thus, the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone is the first example of a LADH-catalyzed reaction for which the stereochemical course could be described in terms of rate constants of the underlying mechanism. 5. The effects of Co(II) substitution on the different steps of the kinetic pathway have been investigated. The free energy of activation is higher for alcohol oxidation and lower for ketone reduction when catalyzed by Co(II)LADH in comparison to Zn(II)LADH. However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors. In this regard, the interactions of substrate molecules with the protein moiety are dominant over the interactions with the catalytic metal ion.","['2-pentanone', 'NADH']","['pentan-2-ol', 'NAD+']","['CCCC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']","['CCCC(C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid. When applying cofactor regeneration at high pH, however, the ratio of acid to alcohol could be changed, and full conversion to the carboxylic acid was achieved.","['2-phenylethanol', 'NAD+']","['2-phenylethanone', 'NADH', 'H+']","['C1=CC=C(C=C1)CCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['C1=CC=C(C=C1)CC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

Importantly, among the 12 aldehydes tested, a general preference for the (S)-antipode was observed, with high ee's for substrates corresponding to the NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) naproxen, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, and fenoprofen. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a dehydrogenase from this Sulfolobus hyperthermophile to asymmetric synthesis and the first example of a DYRKR with such an enzyme. The requisite aldehydes are generated by Buchwald-Hartwig-type Pd(0)-mediated alpha-arylation of tert-butyl propionate. This is followed by reduction to the aldehyde in one [lithium diisobutyl tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LDBBA)] or two steps [LAH/Dess-Martin periodinane]. Treatment of the profenal substrates with SsADH in 5% EtOH/phosphate buffer, pH 9, with catalytic NADH at 80 degrees C leads to efficient DYRKR, with ee's exceeding 90% for 9 aryl side chains, including those of the aforementioned NSAIDs. An in silico model, consistent with the observed broad side chain tolerance, is presented.

The electrophoretic mobilities of ScbADH1, SceADH2 and commercial ADH are similar. The kinetics and specificities of ScbADH1 and SceADH1 acting on branched, long-chain and benzyl alcohols are very similar, but the catalytic efficiency of SceADH2 is about 10-100-fold higher on these substrates. A three-dimensional structure of SceADH1 shows that the substrate binding pocket has Met-270, whereas SceADH2 has Leu-270, which allows larger substrates to bind. The reduction of a series of p-substituted benzaldehydes catalyzed by SceADH2 is significantly enhanced by electron-withdrawing groups, whereas the oxidation of p-substituted aromatic alcohols may be only slightly affected by the substituents. The substituent effects on catalysis generally reflect the effects on the equilibrium constant for the reaction, where electron-withdrawing substituents favor alcohol.

NAD+ in micromolar concentration protects the enzyme against the inhibitor in an uncompetitive manner, while imidazole significantly increases the extent of the activation. Carboxymethylation selectively modifies one out of five cysteine residues per subunit, namely, Cys 38, located in the catalytic site, as determined by peptide and sequence analysis, and enhances by up to 25-fold the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Carboxymethylated SsADH is less thermostable and shows a temperature optimum 30 degrees C lower than that of the native enzyme.

The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 are 60- and 200-fold higher, respectively, compared to the native enzyme. The significant isotope effect in alcohol oxidation suggests that hydride transfer partially limits the turnover rate of the reaction catalyzed by the modified enzyme, whereas the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme is NADH dissociation.

TADH is a NAD(H)-dependent enzyme and shows a very broad substrate spectrum producing exclusively the (S)-enantiomer in high enantiomeric excess (>99%) during asymmetric reduction of ketones. TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates.

The archaeal ADH is chemically modified and activated in a Michaelis-Menten-type reaction, where one molecule of the reagent binds per active site. NAD+ in micromolar concentration protects the enzyme against the inhibitor in an uncompetitive manner, while imidazole significantly increases the extent of the activation. Carboxymethylation selectively modifies one out of five cysteine residues per subunit, namely, Cys 38, located in the catalytic site, as determined by peptide and sequence analysis, and enhances by up to 25-fold the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Carboxymethylated SsADH is less thermostable and shows a temperature optimum 30 degrees C lower than that of the native enzyme. The carboxymethylated enzyme exhibits a lower affinity toward the oxidized and reduced coenzyme. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 are 60- and 200-fold higher, respectively, compared to the native enzyme. The significant isotope effect in alcohol oxidation suggests that hydride transfer partially limits the turnover rate of the reaction catalyzed by the modified enzyme, whereas the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme is NADH dissociation. Carboxymethylated enzyme probably gives higher maximum velocities of oxidation because of the faster dissociation of the modified enzyme-coenzyme complex.","['2-propanol', 'NAD+']","['2-propanone', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CC(C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

To our knowledge, this is the first application of a dehydrogenase from this Sulfolobus hyperthermophile to asymmetric synthesis and the first example of a DYRKR with such an enzyme. The requisite aldehydes are generated by Buchwald-Hartwig-type Pd(0)-mediated alpha-arylation of tert-butyl propionate.

The enzyme reduced 2,3-butanedione, 2-hexanone, cyclohexanone, propionaldehyde, n-butylaldehyde, n-hexylaldehyde, n-octylaldehyde, n-valeraldehyde, and benzylacetone more effectively than it did N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinone. No activity was detected towards N-benzyl-2-pyrrolidinone or 2-pyrrolidinone. The activity towards (R)-N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol was not detected under the assay conditions employed. The oxidizing activity of the enzyme was higher towards 2-propanol, 2-butanol, 2-pentanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol, and 1-phenyl-2-propanol than towards (S)-N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol. The K(m) values for N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinone reduction and (S)-N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol oxidation were 0.13 and 8.47 mM, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol/N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinone oxidoreductase was purified from a eukaryote; moreover, this is the first report of (S)-N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol dehydrogenase activity in microorganisms. This enzyme showed features different from those of known prokaryotic N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinone reductases. This enzyme will be very useful for the production of chiral compounds.","['3,4-hexanedione', 'NADH', 'H+']",['?'],"['CCC(=O)C(=O)CC', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']",[]

The archaeal ADH is chemically modified and activated in a Michaelis-Menten-type reaction, where one molecule of the reagent binds per active site. NAD+ in micromolar concentration protects the enzyme against the inhibitor in an uncompetitive manner, while imidazole significantly increases the extent of the activation. Carboxymethylation selectively modifies one out of five cysteine residues per subunit, namely, Cys 38, located in the catalytic site, as determined by peptide and sequence analysis, and enhances by up to 25-fold the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Carboxymethylated SsADH is less thermostable and shows a temperature optimum 30 degrees C lower than that of the native enzyme. The carboxymethylated enzyme exhibits a lower affinity toward the oxidized and reduced coenzyme. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 are 60- and 200-fold higher, respectively, compared to the native enzyme. The significant isotope effect in alcohol oxidation suggests that hydride transfer partially limits the turnover rate of the reaction catalyzed by the modified enzyme, whereas the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme is NADH dissociation. Carboxymethylated enzyme probably gives higher maximum velocities of oxidation because of the faster dissociation of the modified enzyme-coenzyme complex.","['3-bromobenzyl alcohol', 'NAD+']","['3-bromobenzaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['C1=CC(=CC(=C1)Br)CO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['C1=CC(=CC(=C1)Br)C=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

The archaeal ADH is chemically modified and activated in a Michaelis-Menten-type reaction, where one molecule of the reagent binds per active site. NAD+ in micromolar concentration protects the enzyme against the inhibitor in an uncompetitive manner, while imidazole significantly increases the extent of the activation. Carboxymethylation selectively modifies one out of five cysteine residues per subunit, namely, Cys 38, located in the catalytic site, as determined by peptide and sequence analysis, and enhances by up to 25-fold the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Carboxymethylated SsADH is less thermostable and shows a temperature optimum 30 degrees C lower than that of the native enzyme. The carboxymethylated enzyme exhibits a lower affinity toward the oxidized and reduced coenzyme. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 are 60- and 200-fold higher, respectively, compared to the native enzyme. The significant isotope effect in alcohol oxidation suggests that hydride transfer partially limits the turnover rate of the reaction catalyzed by the modified enzyme, whereas the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme is NADH dissociation. Carboxymethylated enzyme probably gives higher maximum velocities of oxidation because of the faster dissociation of the modified enzyme-coenzyme complex.","['3-methoxybenzyl alcohol', 'NAD+']","['3-methoxybenzaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['COC1=CC=CC(=C1)CO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['COC1=CC=CC(=C1)C=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated.

D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting. Pyrazole was an ethanol-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The difference spectra of the enzyme-NAD+-pyrazole complex gave an absorption peak at 305 nm with epsilon 305 14.5 X 10(3) M-1 X cm-1. Concentrations and amounts of active enzyme can thus be determined. A kinetic rate assay to determine the concentration of enzyme active sites is also presented.

TADH is a NAD(H)-dependent enzyme and shows a very broad substrate spectrum producing exclusively the (S)-enantiomer in high enantiomeric excess (>99%) during asymmetric reduction of ketones. TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid.

Two highly divergent ADH genes (15% identity at the amino acid level) of Cantaloupe Charentais melon (Cucumis melo var. Cantalupensis) have been isolated. Cm-ADH1 belongs to the medium-chain zinc-binding type of ADHs and is highly similar to all ADH genes expressed in fruit isolated so far. Cm-ADH2 belongs to the short-chain type of ADHs. The two encoded proteins are enzymatically active upon expression in yeast. Cm-ADH1 has strong preference for NAPDH as a co-factor, whereas Cm-ADH2 preferentially uses NADH. Both Cm-ADH proteins are much more active as reductases with K (m)s 10-20 times lower for the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols than for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes. They both show strong preference for aliphatic aldehydes but Cm-ADH1 is capable of reducing branched aldehydes such as 3-methylbutyraldehyde, whereas Cm-ADH2 cannot. Both Cm-ADH genes are expressed specifically in fruit and up-regulated during ripening. Gene expression as well as total ADH activity are strongly inhibited in antisense ACC oxidase melons and in melon fruit treated with the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), indicating a positive regulation by ethylene.

Interestingly, the enzyme catalyses the asymmetric reduction of benzil to (R)-benzoin with both excellent conversion (98 %) and optical purity (98 %) by way of an efficient in situ NADH-recycling system involving a second thermophilic ADH.

A combined evaluation of steady-state kinetic data and rate constants obtained from stopped-flow measurements, allowed the determination of all rate constants of the following ordered bi-bi mechanism: E in equilibrium E.NAD in equilibrium E.NAD.R1R2 CHOH in equilibrium E.NADH.R1R2CO in equilibrium E.NADH in equilibrium E. 3. On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4. The observed enantioselectivity implies the existence of two productive ternary complexes; E.NADH.(pro-S) 2-butanone and E.NADH.(pro-R) 2-butanone. All rate constants describing the kinetic pathways of the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone have been determined. These data have been used to estimate the expected enantiomer product composition of 2-butanone reductions using apparent kcat/Km values for the two different ternary-complex configurations of 2-butanone. Additionally, these data have been used for computer simulations of the corresponding reaction cycles. Calculated, simulated and experimental data were found to be in good agreement. Thus, the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone is the first example of a LADH-catalyzed reaction for which the stereochemical course could be described in terms of rate constants of the underlying mechanism. 5. The effects of Co(II) substitution on the different steps of the kinetic pathway have been investigated. The free energy of activation is higher for alcohol oxidation and lower for ketone reduction when catalyzed by Co(II)LADH in comparison to Zn(II)LADH. However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors. In this regard, the interactions of substrate molecules with the protein moiety are dominant over the interactions with the catalytic metal ion.","['3-pentanone', 'NADH']","['pentan-3-ol', 'NAD+']","['CCC(=O)CC', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']","['CCC(CC)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

Eight isoenzymes of different subunit composition (alpha gamma 2, gamma 2 gamma 2, alpha gamma 1, alpha beta 1, beta 1 gamma 2, gamma 1 gamma 1, beta 1 gamma 1, and beta 1 beta 1) were purified, and their activities were measured at pH 10.0 by using ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol, benzyl alcohol, octanol, cyclohexanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid as substrates. Values of Km and kcat for all the isoenzymes, except beta 1 beta 1-ADH, were similar for the oxidation of ethanol but varied markedly for other alcohols. The kcat values for beta 1 beta 1-ADH were invariant (approximately 10 min-1) and much lower (5-15-fold) than those for any other class I isoenzyme studied. Km values for methanol and ethylene glycol were from 5- to 100-fold greater than those for ethanol, depending on the isoenzyme, while those for benzyl alcohol, octanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were usually 100-1000-fold lower than those for ethanol. The homodimer beta 1 beta 1 had the lowest kcat/Km value for all alcohols studied except methanol and ethylene glycol; kcat values were relatively constant for all isoenzymes acting on all alcohols, and, hence, specificity was manifested principally in the value of Km. Values of Km and kcat/Km revealed for all enzymes examined that the short chain alcohols are the poorest while alcohols with bulky substituents are much better substrates. The experimental values of the kinetic parameters for heterodimers deviate from the calculated average of those of their parent homodimers and, hence, cannot be predicted from the behavior of the latter. Thus, the specificities of both the hetero- and homodimeric isoenzymes of ADH toward a given substrate are characteristics of each. Ethanol proved to be one of the ""poorest"" substrates examined for all class I isoenzymes which are the predominant forms of the human enzyme. On the basis of kinetic criteria, none of the isoenzymes of class I studied oxidized ethanol in a manner that would indicate an enzymatic preference for that alcohol.","['3-phenyl-1-propanol', 'NAD+']","['3-phenyl-1-propanone', 'NADH']","['C1=CC=C(C=C1)CCCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['O=CCCc1ccccc1', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

One of these isozymes, TT-ADH, found only in the testes of golden hamsters was previously purified and partially characterized (Keung WM: Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 156:38-45, 1988). The other two, AA- and BB-ADH, which are most abundant in the liver, have now been purified by affinity chromatography on 4-(3-(N-(6-aminocaproyl)amino)propyl)pyrazole-sepharose and testosterone-17 beta-hemisuccinate-agarose. Hamster AA-, BB-, and TT-ADH are all homodimers of molecular weight near 80,000 and each contains 4 atoms of zinc. Amino acid analyses show that BB-ADH is most closely related to the gamma-form of human class I ADH, whereas AA- and TT-ADH are most closely related to the beta-form of the human enzyme. BB-ADH is the only hamster ADH that is active toward sterols and sensitive to testosterone and isoflavone inhibition. These results suggest that hamster BB- and human gamma gamma-ADH also share similar catalytic properties. AA- and TT-ADH are neither active toward sterols nor sensitive to testosterone or isoflavone inhibition; thus, they are functionally different from the human alpha alpha- or gamma gamma-ADHs. Compared with AA- and BB-ADH, TT-ADH exhibits much higher Km values toward primary aliphatic alcohols and cyclohexanol. AA- and BB-ADH share similar substrate specificities toward primary aliphatic alcohols. However, they exhibit different stereospecificities for secondary alcohols.

The T. thermophilus ADH gene (adh(Tt)) was heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein (ADH(Tt)) was purified to homogeneity and characterized. ADH(Tt) is a tetrameric enzyme consisting of identical 26,961-Da subunits composed of 256 amino acids.

ADH(Tt) has a strict requirement for NAD(H) as the coenzyme, a preference for reduction of aromatic ketones and alpha-keto esters, and poor activity on aromatic alcohols and aldehydes. This thermophilic enzyme catalyzes the following reactions with Prelog specificity: the reduction of acetophenone, 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone, alpha-tetralone, and alpha-methyl and alpha-ethyl benzoylformates to (S)-(-)-1-phenylethanol (>99% enantiomeric excess [ee]), (R)-alpha-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl alcohol (93% ee), (S)-alpha-tetralol (>99% ee), methyl (R)-(-)-mandelate (92% ee), and ethyl (R)-(-)-mandelate (95% ee), respectively, by way of an efficient in situ NADH-recycling system involving 2-propanol and a second thermophilic ADH.

We previously showed that co-administration of ethanol or 4-methylpyrazole strongly enhances DNA adduct formation by 1-hydroxymethylpyrene, indicating an involvement of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in the detoxification. This mechanism may be involved in the observed synergism of smoking and alcohol consumption in certain human cancers. In a preceding study, cDNA-expressed human ADH2 efficiently oxidised 1-, 2- and 4-hydroxymethylpyrene; these reactions were inhibited in the presence of ethanol or 4-methylpyrazole. Here we report that ADH1C, ADH3 and ADH4 also show substantial activity towards these substrates and two further congeners, 1-hydroxymethyl-6-methylpyrene and 1-hydroxymethyl-8-methylpyrene. All four ADH forms also catalysed the reverse reaction, implying that the aldehydes have to be sequestered by other enzymes, such as aldehyde dehydrogenases, for final detoxification. ADH1C and ADH4 activities towards hydroxymethylpyrenes were more strongly inhibited in the presence of ethanol and 4-methylpyrazole than those of ADH2. ADH3 was only inhibited at very high concentrations of the modulators. In conclusions, several human ADHs are capable of detoxifying benzylic alcohols of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

The mutant enzyme, which was purified from Escherichia coli to homogeneous form, exhibits a specific activity that is more than 6-fold greater than that of the wild type enzyme, as measured at 65 degrees C with benzyl alcohol as the substrate. The oxidation rate of aliphatic alcohols and the reduction rate of aromatic aldehydes were also higher. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 were 3 orders of magnitude greater compared to those of the wild type enzyme. It is thought that the higher turnover of the mutant SsADH is due to the faster dissociation of the modified enzyme-coenzyme complex. Spectroscopic studies showed no relevant changes in either secondary or tertiary structure, while analysis with fluorescent probes revealed a significant increase in surface hydrophobicity for the mutant, with respect to that of the wild type molecule. The mutant SsADH displays improved thermal stability, as indicated by the increase in Tm from 90 to 93 degrees C, which was determined by the apparent transition curves. Kinetic thermal stability studies at pH 9.0 for mutant SsADH showed a marked increase in activation enthalpy compensated by an entropy gain, which resulted in a higher activation barrier against thermal unfolding of the enzyme. Ammonia analysis showed that the Asn249Tyr substitution produced the effect of markedly reducing the extent of deamidation during thermoinactivation, thus suggesting that Asn249 plays a significant role in the mechanism of irreversible thermal denaturation of the archaeal ADH. Furthermore, the decrease in the activating effect by moderate concentrations of denaturants and studies with proteases and chelating agents point to an increase in structural rigidity and a tightening of structural zinc as additional factors responsible for the improved thermal resistance of the mutant enzyme.","['4-methoxybenzyl alcohol', 'NAD+']","['4-methoxybenzaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['COC1=CC=C(C=C1)CO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['COC1=CC=C(C=C1)C=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

The Trp95Leu mutant displays no apparent activity with short-chain primary and secondary alcohols and poor activity with aromatic substrates and coenzyme. Moreover, the Trp --> Leu substitution affects the structural stability of the archaeal ADH, decreasing its thermal stability without relevant changes in secondary structure.

The archaeal ADH is chemically modified and activated in a Michaelis-Menten-type reaction, where one molecule of the reagent binds per active site. NAD+ in micromolar concentration protects the enzyme against the inhibitor in an uncompetitive manner, while imidazole significantly increases the extent of the activation. Carboxymethylation selectively modifies one out of five cysteine residues per subunit, namely, Cys 38, located in the catalytic site, as determined by peptide and sequence analysis, and enhances by up to 25-fold the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Carboxymethylated SsADH is less thermostable and shows a temperature optimum 30 degrees C lower than that of the native enzyme. The carboxymethylated enzyme exhibits a lower affinity toward the oxidized and reduced coenzyme. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 are 60- and 200-fold higher, respectively, compared to the native enzyme. The significant isotope effect in alcohol oxidation suggests that hydride transfer partially limits the turnover rate of the reaction catalyzed by the modified enzyme, whereas the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme is NADH dissociation. Carboxymethylated enzyme probably gives higher maximum velocities of oxidation because of the faster dissociation of the modified enzyme-coenzyme complex.","['4-nitrobenzaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['4-nitrobenzyl alcohol', 'NAD+']","['C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)[N+](=O)[O-]', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']","['C1=CC(=CC=C1CO)[N+](=O)[O-]', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

The analogues having 1N-methyltetrazol-5-yl attached to the C8-position (3a, 4a, R1 = R2 = F) are the most active in suppressing cholesterol biosynthesis in both in vitro and in vivo models: the IC50 for the chiral form of 3a is 19 nM, Ki = 4.3 x 10(-9)M when Km for HMG-CoA is 28 x 10(-6) M;1 the ED50 (oral) value corresponding to the lactone derivative (4a, BMY 22089) is approximately 0.1 mg/kg. Further, BMY 21950 is nearly 2 orders of magnitude more active in parenchymal heptaocytes, from which most of the serum cholesterol originates, than in other cell preparations (such as spleen, testes, ileum, adrenal, and ocular lens epithelial cells; Table III). This apparent tissue specificity may be highly beneficial since the blocking of cholesterol biosynthesis in other vital organs could eventually lead to undesirable side effects. In addition to the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation, a theoretical study aimed at relating the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory potency to the three-dimensional structure of the inhibitors was undertaken. With a combination of molecular mapping and 3D-QSAR techniques, it was possible to determine a logical candidate for the conformation of the bound inhibitor and to quantitatively relate inhibitory potency to the shape and size of both the binding site and the C8-substituent.","['6-benzyloxy-3,5-dioxo-hexanoic acid ethyl ester', 'NADH', 'H+']","['(3R,5S)-6-benzyloxy-3,5-dihydroxy-hexanoic acid ethyl ester', 'NAD+']","['CCOC(=O)CC(=O)CC(=O)COCc1ccccc1', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']","['CCOC(=O)C[C@H](O)C[C@H](O)COCc1ccccc1', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

Adh3 has been identified by genome BLASTP analyses using the amino acid sequence of 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase DhaT from Klebsiella pneumoniae and group III alcohol dehydrogenases with known activity towards 1,3-propanediol as target sequences. The recombinant protein was purified in a two-step column chromatography approach. Crystal structure determination and biochemical characterisation confirmed that Adh3 forms a Ni(2+)-containing homodimer in its active form. Adh3 catalyses the interconversion of ethanol and its corresponding aldehyde acetaldyhyde and is also capable of using other alcoholic compounds as substrates, such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol and 1-propanol.

Adh3 is strictly dependent on NAD(+)/NADH, whereas no activity has been observed with NADP(+)/NADPH as co-factor.

The equilibrium constant for HLAMe oxidation to the aldehyde (OLAMe) with NAD(+) was determined as 2.16 × 10(-3) from the kinetic parameters of the BsADH-catalyzed forward and reverse reactions. Since BsADH displayed limited stability under oxidizing conditions, the predominant oxidation-prone residue Cys257 was mutated to Leu based on sequence homology with related enzymes and computational simulation. This substitution resulted in an improved BsADH variant exhibiting prolonged stability and an elevated inactivation temperature. Semi-preparative biocatalysis at 60 °C using the stabilized enzyme, employing butyraldehyde for in situ cofactor regeneration with only catalytic amounts of NAD(+), yielded up to 23 % conversion of HLAMe to OLAMe after 30 min.

Moreover, HpADH3 deletion did not affect the cell growth on different carbon sources. However, when the HpADH3 mutant was complemented by an HpADH3 expression cassette fused to a strong constitutive promoter, the resulting strain produced a significantly increased amount of ethanol compared to the wild-type strain in a glucose medium.

ADH-hT was endowed with catalytic activity and resistance in the presence of several denaturing agents (organic solvents, detergents, chaotropic agents). ADH-hT shared with ADH 1503 (the alcohol dehydrogenase from B. stearothermophilus strain NCA 1503 which grows at 55 degrees C) the optimal temperature of 65 degrees C, but it was more resistant than ADH 1503 towards heating.

Due to their versatile specificities, these biocatalysts are of great interest for industrial applications. The adh3-gene encoding a group III alcohol dehydrogenase was isolated from the gram-positive bacterium Oenococcus oeni and was characterised after expression in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Adh3 has been identified by genome BLASTP analyses using the amino acid sequence of 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase DhaT from Klebsiella pneumoniae and group III alcohol dehydrogenases with known activity towards 1,3-propanediol as target sequences. The recombinant protein was purified in a two-step column chromatography approach. Crystal structure determination and biochemical characterisation confirmed that Adh3 forms a Ni(2+)-containing homodimer in its active form. Adh3 catalyses the interconversion of ethanol and its corresponding aldehyde acetaldyhyde and is also capable of using other alcoholic compounds as substrates, such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol and 1-propanol. In the presence of Ni(2+), activity increases towards 1,3-propanediol and 1,2-propanediol. Adh3 is strictly dependent on NAD(+)/NADH, whereas no activity has been observed with NADP(+)/NADPH as co-factor. The enzyme exhibits a specific activity of 1.1 U/mg using EtOH as substrate with an optimal pH value of 9.0 for ethanol oxidation and 8.0 for aldehyde reduction. Moreover, Adh3 exhibits tolerance to several metal ions and organic solvents, but is completely inhibited in the presence of Zn(2+).

Many of these organisms also contain a separate alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhA) that generates ethanol from acetaldehyde, although the role of AdhA in ethanol production is typically not clear. As acetyl-CoA is a key central metabolite that can be generated from a wide range of substrates, AdhE can serve as a single gene fuel module to produce ethanol through primary metabolic pathways.

Cm-ADH1 belongs to the medium-chain zinc-binding type of ADHs and is highly similar to all ADH genes expressed in fruit isolated so far. Cm-ADH2 belongs to the short-chain type of ADHs. The two encoded proteins are enzymatically active upon expression in yeast. Cm-ADH1 has strong preference for NAPDH as a co-factor, whereas Cm-ADH2 preferentially uses NADH. Both Cm-ADH proteins are much more active as reductases with K (m)s 10-20 times lower for the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols than for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes. They both show strong preference for aliphatic aldehydes but Cm-ADH1 is capable of reducing branched aldehydes such as 3-methylbutyraldehyde, whereas Cm-ADH2 cannot. Both Cm-ADH genes are expressed specifically in fruit and up-regulated during ripening. Gene expression as well as total ADH activity are strongly inhibited in antisense ACC oxidase melons and in melon fruit treated with the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), indicating a positive regulation by ethylene.

A combined evaluation of steady-state kinetic data and rate constants obtained from stopped-flow measurements, allowed the determination of all rate constants of the following ordered bi-bi mechanism: E in equilibrium E.NAD in equilibrium E.NAD.R1R2 CHOH in equilibrium E.NADH.R1R2CO in equilibrium E.NADH in equilibrium E. 3. On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4. The observed enantioselectivity implies the existence of two productive ternary complexes; E.NADH.(pro-S) 2-butanone and E.NADH.(pro-R) 2-butanone. All rate constants describing the kinetic pathways of the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone have been determined. These data have been used to estimate the expected enantiomer product composition of 2-butanone reductions using apparent kcat/Km values for the two different ternary-complex configurations of 2-butanone. Additionally, these data have been used for computer simulations of the corresponding reaction cycles. Calculated, simulated and experimental data were found to be in good agreement. Thus, the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone is the first example of a LADH-catalyzed reaction for which the stereochemical course could be described in terms of rate constants of the underlying mechanism. 5. The effects of Co(II) substitution on the different steps of the kinetic pathway have been investigated. The free energy of activation is higher for alcohol oxidation and lower for ketone reduction when catalyzed by Co(II)LADH in comparison to Zn(II)LADH. However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors. In this regard, the interactions of substrate molecules with the protein moiety are dominant over the interactions with the catalytic metal ion.","['acetone', 'NADH']","['isopropanol', 'NAD+']","['CC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']","['CC(C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated.

By oxidation of HMGSH, the spontaneous glutathione adduct of formaldehyde, ADH3 is implicated in the detoxification of formaldehyde. Through the GSNO reductase activity, ADH3 can affect the transnitrosation equilibrium between GSNO and S-nitrosated proteins, arguing for an important role in NO homeostasis.

The 373-amino acid sigma-ADH encoded by this cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme for ethanol oxidation at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, calculated from active-site titration of NADH binding, was 92 +/- 9 units/mg. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site. The deletion of Gly-117 in human sigma-ADH and a substitution of Leu for the bulky Tyr-110 appear to facilitate retinol access to the active-site zinc.","['all-trans-retinol', 'NAD+']","['all-trans-retinal', 'NADH']","['CC1=C(C(CCC1)(C)C)/C=C/C(=C/C=C/C(=C/CO)/C)/C', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC1=C(C(CCC1)(C)C)/C=C/C(=C/C=C/C(=C/C=O)/C)/C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

BB-ADH is the only hamster ADH that is active toward sterols and sensitive to testosterone and isoflavone inhibition. These results suggest that hamster BB- and human gamma gamma-ADH also share similar catalytic properties. AA- and TT-ADH are neither active toward sterols nor sensitive to testosterone or isoflavone inhibition; thus, they are functionally different from the human alpha alpha- or gamma gamma-ADHs.

Under both these growth conditions, the cells contained a fraction, ADHII, which was characterized by its electrophoretic properties, by a high degree of resistance to heat inactivation, by a sharp pH optimum at 8.2 and by its kinetic properties. The estimated molecular weight of this fraction was approx. 150000, which is similar to that of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. 3. Cells grown in air+CO(2) (95:5) contain another fraction, ADHI, which can be further separated into two subfractions by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. This was termed fraction ;ADHI-air'. 4. In addition to fraction ADHII, cells grown in the presence of O(2) have a twofold increase in fraction ADHI-air activity as well as two new fractions that could not be demonstrated in air-grown cells. These new fractions which we have called fraction ;ADHI-O(2)', account for about 10% of the total activity. 5. The ADHI fractions (air) and (O(2)) have similar broad pH-activity curves and similar kinetic properties, both having a lower K(m) for ethanol and NAD than fraction ADHII.

Both Cm-ADH proteins are much more active as reductases with K (m)s 10-20 times lower for the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols than for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes. They both show strong preference for aliphatic aldehydes but Cm-ADH1 is capable of reducing branched aldehydes such as 3-methylbutyraldehyde, whereas Cm-ADH2 cannot.

Furthermore, a flavin-binding motif and signature patterns conserved in type III FAD-dependent alcohol oxidases were detected. Two open reading frames (ORFs) were found upstream of adh1, encoding a putative acyl-CoA synthetase and a putative esterase. Downstream of adh1 and located on the opposite strand was an ORF encoding a putative aldehyde dehydrogenase. Transcription analysis using RT-PCR showed that adh1 is cotranscribed with the putative acyl-CoA synthetase and esterase genes during growth on OPEO(n). ADH1 overproduced in Escherichia coli exhibited activity not only toward various alcohols, including OPEO(n)s, but also toward primary aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes.","['benzaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['benzyl alcohol', 'NAD+']","['C1=CC=C(C=C1)C=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']","['C1=CC=C(C=C1)CO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

Within the ADH2 class, the rodent enzymes form a subgroup that exhibits low catalytic activity with all substrates that were examined, as compared to other groups, such as human ADH2. The low activity can be ascribed to the rigid nature of the proline residue at position 47 as the activity can be increased by approximately 100-fold by substituting Pro47 with either His (as found in human ADH2), Ala, or Gln. Mouse ADH2 follows an ordered bi-bi mechanism, and hydride transfer is rate-limiting for oxidation of benzyl alcohols catalyzed by the mutated and wild-type enzymes. Structural studies suggest that the mouse enzyme with His47 has a more closed active site, as compared to the enzyme with Pro47, and hydride transfer can be more efficient. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by all forms of the enzyme is strongly pH dependent, with pK values in the range of 8.1-9.3 for turnover numbers and catalytic efficiency. These pK values probably correspond to the ionization of the zinc-bound water or alcohol.

Values of Km and kcat for all the isoenzymes, except beta 1 beta 1-ADH, were similar for the oxidation of ethanol but varied markedly for other alcohols.

Km values for methanol and ethylene glycol were from 5- to 100-fold greater than those for ethanol, depending on the isoenzyme, while those for benzyl alcohol, octanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were usually 100-1000-fold lower than those for ethanol. The homodimer beta 1 beta 1 had the lowest kcat/Km value for all alcohols studied except methanol and ethylene glycol; kcat values were relatively constant for all isoenzymes acting on all alcohols, and, hence, specificity was manifested principally in the value of Km. Values of Km and kcat/Km revealed for all enzymes examined that the short chain alcohols are the poorest while alcohols with bulky substituents are much better substrates. The experimental values of the kinetic parameters for heterodimers deviate from the calculated average of those of their parent homodimers and, hence, cannot be predicted from the behavior of the latter.

The archaeal ADH is chemically modified and activated in a Michaelis-Menten-type reaction, where one molecule of the reagent binds per active site. NAD+ in micromolar concentration protects the enzyme against the inhibitor in an uncompetitive manner, while imidazole significantly increases the extent of the activation. Carboxymethylation selectively modifies one out of five cysteine residues per subunit, namely, Cys 38, located in the catalytic site, as determined by peptide and sequence analysis, and enhances by up to 25-fold the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Carboxymethylated SsADH is less thermostable and shows a temperature optimum 30 degrees C lower than that of the native enzyme. The carboxymethylated enzyme exhibits a lower affinity toward the oxidized and reduced coenzyme. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 are 60- and 200-fold higher, respectively, compared to the native enzyme. The significant isotope effect in alcohol oxidation suggests that hydride transfer partially limits the turnover rate of the reaction catalyzed by the modified enzyme, whereas the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme is NADH dissociation.

The mutant enzyme, which was purified from Escherichia coli to homogeneous form, exhibits a specific activity that is more than 6-fold greater than that of the wild type enzyme, as measured at 65 degrees C with benzyl alcohol as the substrate. The oxidation rate of aliphatic alcohols and the reduction rate of aromatic aldehydes were also higher. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 were 3 orders of magnitude greater compared to those of the wild type enzyme. It is thought that the higher turnover of the mutant SsADH is due to the faster dissociation of the modified enzyme-coenzyme complex. Spectroscopic studies showed no relevant changes in either secondary or tertiary structure, while analysis with fluorescent probes revealed a significant increase in surface hydrophobicity for the mutant, with respect to that of the wild type molecule. The mutant SsADH displays improved thermal stability, as indicated by the increase in Tm from 90 to 93 degrees C, which was determined by the apparent transition curves. Kinetic thermal stability studies at pH 9.0 for mutant SsADH showed a marked increase in activation enthalpy compensated by an entropy gain, which resulted in a higher activation barrier against thermal unfolding of the enzyme. Ammonia analysis showed that the Asn249Tyr substitution produced the effect of markedly reducing the extent of deamidation during thermoinactivation, thus suggesting that Asn249 plays a significant role in the mechanism of irreversible thermal denaturation of the archaeal ADH.

These residues, ca. 32 Å apart, are shown to exhibit opposing low-temperature effects on the hydride tunneling step. Using single-tryptophan constructs at the active site (Trp87) and a remote, surface-exposed site (Trp167), time-dependent Stokes shifts and collisional quenching data allow an analysis of intra-protein dynamical communication. A double mutant, Y25A:V260A, was also inserted into each single-Trp construct and analyzed accordingly. None of the mutations affect fluorescence lifetimes, Stokes shift relaxation rates, and quenching data for the surface-exposed Trp167 to an appreciable extent. By contrast, fluorescent probes of the active-site tryptophan 87 reveal distinctive forms of dynamical communication. Stokes shifts show that the distal Y25A increases active-site flexibility, V260A introduces a temperature-dependent equilibration process not previously reported by such measurements, and the double mutant (Y25A:V260A) eliminates the temperature-dependent transition sensed by the active-site tryptophan in the presence of V260A. Collisional quenching data at Trp87 further show a structural change in the active-site environment/solvation for V260A. In the aggregate, the temperature dependencies of the fluorescence data are distinct from the breaks in behavior previously reported for catalysis and hydrogen/deuterium exchange, attributed to time scales for the interconversion of protein conformational substates that are slower and more global than the local motions monitored within.

ADH-hT was obtained in pure form by anion exchange chromatography and two affinity chromatographies, with a final yield of about 30%. ADH-hT was found to be a tetramer of 37 kDa-subunits, and to have a pI of 4.9. ADH-hT displayed a broad substrate specificity; its activity was highest for aldehydes, and decreased progressively for alcohols and ketones. ADH-hT was endowed with catalytic activity and resistance in the presence of several denaturing agents (organic solvents, detergents, chaotropic agents). ADH-hT shared with ADH 1503 (the alcohol dehydrogenase from B. stearothermophilus strain NCA 1503 which grows at 55 degrees C) the optimal temperature of 65 degrees C, but it was more resistant than ADH 1503 towards heating. In conclusion, due to its stability and broad substrate specificity ADH-hT could be utilized in bio-industrial processes.

The ht-W87A mutation results in a loss of the Arrhenius break seen at 30 °C for the wild-type enzyme and an increase in cold lability that is attributed to destabilization of the active tetrameric form. Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are nearly temperature-independent over the experimental temperature range, and similar in magnitude to those measured above 30 °C for the wild-type enzyme. This suggests that the rigidification in the wild-type enzyme below 30 °C does not occur for ht-W87A. A mutation at the dimer-dimer interface in a thermolabile psychrophilic homologue of ht-ADH, ps-A25Y, leads to a more thermostable enzyme and a change in the rate-determining step at low temperature. The reciprocal mutation in ht-ADH, ht-Y25A, results in kinetic behavior similar to that of W87A. Collectively, the results indicate that flexibility at the active site is intimately connected to a subunit interaction 20 Å away. The convex Arrhenius curves previously reported for ht-ADH (Kohen, A., Cannio, R., Bartolucci, S., and Klinman, J. P. (1999) Nature 399, 496-499) are proposed to arise, at least in part, from a change in subunit interactions that rigidifies the substrate-binding domain below 30 °C, and impedes the ability of the enzyme to sample the catalytically relevant conformational landscape.

A three-dimensional structure of SceADH1 shows that the substrate binding pocket has Met-270, whereas SceADH2 has Leu-270, which allows larger substrates to bind. The reduction of a series of p-substituted benzaldehydes catalyzed by SceADH2 is significantly enhanced by electron-withdrawing groups, whereas the oxidation of p-substituted aromatic alcohols may be only slightly affected by the substituents.

The stereochemistry of the hydride transfer in the oxidation of stereospecifically deuterium labeled n-butanol is identical to that for the reaction with β-NAD(+). In contrast to the activity toward primary alcohols there is no detectable reduction of acycloNAD(+) by secondary alcohols with HLADH although these alcohols serve as competitive inhibitors. The net effect is that acycloNAD(+) has converted horse liver ADH from a broad spectrum alcohol dehydrogenase, capable of utilizing either primary or secondary alcohols, into an exclusively primary alcohol dehydrogenase.

The chemical properties of this analog are comparable to those of β-NAD(+) with a redox potential of -324mV and a 341nm λmax for the reduced form. Both yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH) and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) catalyze the reduction of acycloNAD(+) by primary alcohols. With HLADH 1-butanol has the highest Vmax at 49% that of β-NAD(+). The primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect is greater than 3 indicating a significant contribution to the rate limiting step from cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen bond. The stereochemistry of the hydride transfer in the oxidation of stereospecifically deuterium labeled n-butanol is identical to that for the reaction with β-NAD(+). In contrast to the activity toward primary alcohols there is no detectable reduction of acycloNAD(+) by secondary alcohols with HLADH although these alcohols serve as competitive inhibitors. The net effect is that acycloNAD(+) has converted horse liver ADH from a broad spectrum alcohol dehydrogenase, capable of utilizing either primary or secondary alcohols, into an exclusively primary alcohol dehydrogenase. This is the first example of an NAD analog that alters the substrate specificity of a dehydrogenase and, like site-directed mutagenesis of proteins, establishes that modifications of the coenzyme distance from the active site can be used to alter enzyme function and substrate specificity.

The 373-amino acid sigma-ADH encoded by this cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme for ethanol oxidation at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, calculated from active-site titration of NADH binding, was 92 +/- 9 units/mg. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site. The deletion of Gly-117 in human sigma-ADH and a substitution of Leu for the bulky Tyr-110 appear to facilitate retinol access to the active-site zinc.","['butan-2-ol', 'NAD+']","['butan-2-one', 'NADH']","['CCC(C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

One of these isozymes, TT-ADH, found only in the testes of golden hamsters was previously purified and partially characterized (Keung WM: Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 156:38-45, 1988). The other two, AA- and BB-ADH, which are most abundant in the liver, have now been purified by affinity chromatography on 4-(3-(N-(6-aminocaproyl)amino)propyl)pyrazole-sepharose and testosterone-17 beta-hemisuccinate-agarose. Hamster AA-, BB-, and TT-ADH are all homodimers of molecular weight near 80,000 and each contains 4 atoms of zinc. Amino acid analyses show that BB-ADH is most closely related to the gamma-form of human class I ADH, whereas AA- and TT-ADH are most closely related to the beta-form of the human enzyme. BB-ADH is the only hamster ADH that is active toward sterols and sensitive to testosterone and isoflavone inhibition. These results suggest that hamster BB- and human gamma gamma-ADH also share similar catalytic properties. AA- and TT-ADH are neither active toward sterols nor sensitive to testosterone or isoflavone inhibition; thus, they are functionally different from the human alpha alpha- or gamma gamma-ADHs. Compared with AA- and BB-ADH, TT-ADH exhibits much higher Km values toward primary aliphatic alcohols and cyclohexanol. AA- and BB-ADH share similar substrate specificities toward primary aliphatic alcohols. However, they exhibit different stereospecificities for secondary alcohols. BB-ADH prefers the (R)-(-)-isomer of 2-butanol, whereas AA-ADH prefers the (S)-(-)-isomer.

D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting.

A combined evaluation of steady-state kinetic data and rate constants obtained from stopped-flow measurements, allowed the determination of all rate constants of the following ordered bi-bi mechanism: E in equilibrium E.NAD in equilibrium E.NAD.R1R2 CHOH in equilibrium E.NADH.R1R2CO in equilibrium E.NADH in equilibrium E. 3. On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4. The observed enantioselectivity implies the existence of two productive ternary complexes; E.NADH.(pro-S) 2-butanone and E.NADH.(pro-R) 2-butanone. All rate constants describing the kinetic pathways of the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone have been determined. These data have been used to estimate the expected enantiomer product composition of 2-butanone reductions using apparent kcat/Km values for the two different ternary-complex configurations of 2-butanone. Additionally, these data have been used for computer simulations of the corresponding reaction cycles. Calculated, simulated and experimental data were found to be in good agreement. Thus, the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone is the first example of a LADH-catalyzed reaction for which the stereochemical course could be described in terms of rate constants of the underlying mechanism. 5. The effects of Co(II) substitution on the different steps of the kinetic pathway have been investigated. The free energy of activation is higher for alcohol oxidation and lower for ketone reduction when catalyzed by Co(II)LADH in comparison to Zn(II)LADH. However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors. In this regard, the interactions of substrate molecules with the protein moiety are dominant over the interactions with the catalytic metal ion.","['butan-2-ol', 'NAD+']","['butan-2-one', 'NADH']","['CCC(C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

A combined evaluation of steady-state kinetic data and rate constants obtained from stopped-flow measurements, allowed the determination of all rate constants of the following ordered bi-bi mechanism: E in equilibrium E.NAD in equilibrium E.NAD.R1R2 CHOH in equilibrium E.NADH.R1R2CO in equilibrium E.NADH in equilibrium E. 3. On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4. The observed enantioselectivity implies the existence of two productive ternary complexes; E.NADH.(pro-S) 2-butanone and E.NADH.(pro-R) 2-butanone. All rate constants describing the kinetic pathways of the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone have been determined. These data have been used to estimate the expected enantiomer product composition of 2-butanone reductions using apparent kcat/Km values for the two different ternary-complex configurations of 2-butanone. Additionally, these data have been used for computer simulations of the corresponding reaction cycles. Calculated, simulated and experimental data were found to be in good agreement. Thus, the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone is the first example of a LADH-catalyzed reaction for which the stereochemical course could be described in terms of rate constants of the underlying mechanism. 5. The effects of Co(II) substitution on the different steps of the kinetic pathway have been investigated. The free energy of activation is higher for alcohol oxidation and lower for ketone reduction when catalyzed by Co(II)LADH in comparison to Zn(II)LADH. However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors. In this regard, the interactions of substrate molecules with the protein moiety are dominant over the interactions with the catalytic metal ion.","['butan-2-one', 'NADH']","['butan-2-ol', 'NAD+']","['CCC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']","['CCC(C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency.

There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site.

One of these isozymes, TT-ADH, found only in the testes of golden hamsters was previously purified and partially characterized (Keung WM: Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 156:38-45, 1988). The other two, AA- and BB-ADH, which are most abundant in the liver, have now been purified by affinity chromatography on 4-(3-(N-(6-aminocaproyl)amino)propyl)pyrazole-sepharose and testosterone-17 beta-hemisuccinate-agarose. Hamster AA-, BB-, and TT-ADH are all homodimers of molecular weight near 80,000 and each contains 4 atoms of zinc. Amino acid analyses show that BB-ADH is most closely related to the gamma-form of human class I ADH, whereas AA- and TT-ADH are most closely related to the beta-form of the human enzyme. BB-ADH is the only hamster ADH that is active toward sterols and sensitive to testosterone and isoflavone inhibition. These results suggest that hamster BB- and human gamma gamma-ADH also share similar catalytic properties. AA- and TT-ADH are neither active toward sterols nor sensitive to testosterone or isoflavone inhibition; thus, they are functionally different from the human alpha alpha- or gamma gamma-ADHs. Compared with AA- and BB-ADH, TT-ADH exhibits much higher Km values toward primary aliphatic alcohols and cyclohexanol. AA- and BB-ADH share similar substrate specificities toward primary aliphatic alcohols. However, they exhibit different stereospecificities for secondary alcohols. BB-ADH prefers the (R)-(-)-isomer of 2-butanol, whereas AA-ADH prefers the (S)-(-)-isomer.

Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1.

Aliphatic and alicyclic alcohols serve as substrates for this first reptilian form of the enzyme characterized, with Km values decreasing rapidly from methanol to hexanol, as for the human class I enzymes, and a Km of 1.2 mM for ethanol at pH 9.9. The N-terminus of the 374-residue protein chain is acetyl-blocked. The enzyme is related in descending order to class I > III > V > II of the structurally characterized mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases. This observation is compatible with the presence of a I/III ancestral line. Differences of the enzyme classes exceed those of the species, suggesting an early origin of the classes. Within its enzyme class, the reptilian protein is most closely related to the avian form (82% residue identities), and is closer to the human than to the amphibian form (76%, versus 69%, respectively). This establishes class I alcohol dehydrogenase as an enzyme having fairly constant rate of change during much of vertebrate evolution, approximately 10% residue differences/100 million years of separation between pairs compared. Residues interacting with the substrate and coenzyme are largely conserved. In the alligator enzyme, there are only four replacements in the substrate pocket compared with the human class I gamma subunit, and those are not known to have functional roles. These properties account for the kinetic parameters, and suggest distinct metabolic functions for the class I enzyme in vertebrates. Comparisons of the enzymes of the different vertebrate lines reveal that segment patterns are characteristic features of the class I enzymes. Three segments are 'variable', while two are 'constant', and both these types of segment are identical with those of the classes. There is extensive variability in close proximity to the active site of the enzyme and this appears to constitute a fundamental property of class I liver alcohol dehydrogenases in general.","['butanol', 'NAD+']","['butyraldehyde', 'NADH']","['CCCCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCCC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

The contribution of His-51 to catalysis was studied by characterizing ADH with His-51 substituted with Gln (H51Q). The steady-state kinetic constants for ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction at pH 8 are similar for wild-type and H51Q enzymes. In contrast, the H51Q substitution significantly shifts the pH dependencies for steady-state and transient reactions and decreases by 11-fold the rate constant for the transient oxidation of ethanol at pH 8. Modest substrate deuterium isotope effects indicate that hydride transfer only partially limits the transient oxidation and turnover. Transient data show that the H51Q substitution significantly decreases the rate of isomerization of the enzyme-NAD(+) complex and becomes a limiting step for ethanol oxidation. Isomerization of the enzyme-NAD(+) complex is rate limiting for acetaldehyde reduction catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme, but release of alcohol is limiting for the H51Q enzyme. X-ray crystallography of doubly substituted His51Gln:Lys228Arg ADH complexed with NAD(+) and 2,3- or 2,4-difluorobenzyl alcohol shows that Gln-51 isosterically replaces histidine in interactions with the nicotinamide ribose of the coenzyme and that Arg-228 interacts with the adenosine monophosphate of the coenzyme without affecting the protein conformation.

TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid.

Recombinant BsADH was produced in Escherichia coli as a homogeneous tetrameric enzyme and showed high activity towards the industrially relevant substrate ω-hydroxy lauric acid methyl ester (HLAMe) with K M = 86 μM and 44 U mg(-1). The equilibrium constant for HLAMe oxidation to the aldehyde (OLAMe) with NAD(+) was determined as 2.16 × 10(-3) from the kinetic parameters of the BsADH-catalyzed forward and reverse reactions. Since BsADH displayed limited stability under oxidizing conditions, the predominant oxidation-prone residue Cys257 was mutated to Leu based on sequence homology with related enzymes and computational simulation. This substitution resulted in an improved BsADH variant exhibiting prolonged stability and an elevated inactivation temperature. Semi-preparative biocatalysis at 60 °C using the stabilized enzyme, employing butyraldehyde for in situ cofactor regeneration with only catalytic amounts of NAD(+), yielded up to 23 % conversion of HLAMe to OLAMe after 30 min.

The reduction of CMA (0.5 g/L, 3.8 mmol/L) by the isolated enzyme occurred in 3 h at 50 °C with 97% conversion, and yielded high purity CMO (≥98%) with a yield of 88% and a productivity of 50 g/genzyme.

This zone was located on the cathode side of the origin. Incubation of D. lebanonensis Adh with NAD+ and acetone altered the electrophoretic pattern to more anodal migrating zones. D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting. Pyrazole was an ethanol-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The difference spectra of the enzyme-NAD+-pyrazole complex gave an absorption peak at 305 nm with epsilon 305 14.5 X 10(3) M-1 X cm-1. Concentrations and amounts of active enzyme can thus be determined. A kinetic rate assay to determine the concentration of enzyme active sites is also presented. This has been developed from active site concentrations established by titration at 305 nm of the enzyme and pyrazole with NAD+. In contrast with the amino acid composition, which indicated that D. lebanonensis Adh and the D. melanogaster alleloenzymes were not closely related, the enzymological studies showed that their active sites were similar although differing markedly from those of zinc alcohol dehydrogenases.","['cis-4-methylcyclohexanol', 'NAD+']","['4-methylcyclohexanone', 'NADH']","['CC1CCC(CC1)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC1CCC(=O)CC1', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

Values of Km and kcat for all the isoenzymes, except beta 1 beta 1-ADH, were similar for the oxidation of ethanol but varied markedly for other alcohols. The kcat values for beta 1 beta 1-ADH were invariant (approximately 10 min-1) and much lower (5-15-fold) than those for any other class I isoenzyme studied. Km values for methanol and ethylene glycol were from 5- to 100-fold greater than those for ethanol, depending on the isoenzyme, while those for benzyl alcohol, octanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were usually 100-1000-fold lower than those for ethanol. The homodimer beta 1 beta 1 had the lowest kcat/Km value for all alcohols studied except methanol and ethylene glycol; kcat values were relatively constant for all isoenzymes acting on all alcohols, and, hence, specificity was manifested principally in the value of Km. Values of Km and kcat/Km revealed for all enzymes examined that the short chain alcohols are the poorest while alcohols with bulky substituents are much better substrates. The experimental values of the kinetic parameters for heterodimers deviate from the calculated average of those of their parent homodimers and, hence, cannot be predicted from the behavior of the latter. Thus, the specificities of both the hetero- and homodimeric isoenzymes of ADH toward a given substrate are characteristics of each. Ethanol proved to be one of the ""poorest"" substrates examined for all class I isoenzymes which are the predominant forms of the human enzyme.

BB-ADH is the only hamster ADH that is active toward sterols and sensitive to testosterone and isoflavone inhibition. These results suggest that hamster BB- and human gamma gamma-ADH also share similar catalytic properties. AA- and TT-ADH are neither active toward sterols nor sensitive to testosterone or isoflavone inhibition; thus, they are functionally different from the human alpha alpha- or gamma gamma-ADHs. Compared with AA- and BB-ADH, TT-ADH exhibits much higher Km values toward primary aliphatic alcohols and cyclohexanol. AA- and BB-ADH share similar substrate specificities toward primary aliphatic alcohols. However, they exhibit different stereospecificities for secondary alcohols. BB-ADH prefers the (R)-(-)-isomer of 2-butanol, whereas AA-ADH prefers the (S)-(-)-isomer.

D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1.

Aliphatic and alicyclic alcohols serve as substrates for this first reptilian form of the enzyme characterized, with Km values decreasing rapidly from methanol to hexanol, as for the human class I enzymes, and a Km of 1.2 mM for ethanol at pH 9.9. The N-terminus of the 374-residue protein chain is acetyl-blocked. The enzyme is related in descending order to class I > III > V > II of the structurally characterized mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases. This observation is compatible with the presence of a I/III ancestral line. Differences of the enzyme classes exceed those of the species, suggesting an early origin of the classes. Within its enzyme class, the reptilian protein is most closely related to the avian form (82% residue identities), and is closer to the human than to the amphibian form (76%, versus 69%, respectively). This establishes class I alcohol dehydrogenase as an enzyme having fairly constant rate of change during much of vertebrate evolution, approximately 10% residue differences/100 million years of separation between pairs compared. Residues interacting with the substrate and coenzyme are largely conserved. In the alligator enzyme, there are only four replacements in the substrate pocket compared with the human class I gamma subunit, and those are not known to have functional roles. These properties account for the kinetic parameters, and suggest distinct metabolic functions for the class I enzyme in vertebrates. Comparisons of the enzymes of the different vertebrate lines reveal that segment patterns are characteristic features of the class I enzymes. Three segments are 'variable', while two are 'constant', and both these types of segment are identical with those of the classes.

The mutant enzyme, which was purified from Escherichia coli to homogeneous form, exhibits a specific activity that is more than 6-fold greater than that of the wild type enzyme, as measured at 65 degrees C with benzyl alcohol as the substrate. The oxidation rate of aliphatic alcohols and the reduction rate of aromatic aldehydes were also higher. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 were 3 orders of magnitude greater compared to those of the wild type enzyme. It is thought that the higher turnover of the mutant SsADH is due to the faster dissociation of the modified enzyme-coenzyme complex. Spectroscopic studies showed no relevant changes in either secondary or tertiary structure, while analysis with fluorescent probes revealed a significant increase in surface hydrophobicity for the mutant, with respect to that of the wild type molecule. The mutant SsADH displays improved thermal stability, as indicated by the increase in Tm from 90 to 93 degrees C, which was determined by the apparent transition curves. Kinetic thermal stability studies at pH 9.0 for mutant SsADH showed a marked increase in activation enthalpy compensated by an entropy gain, which resulted in a higher activation barrier against thermal unfolding of the enzyme. Ammonia analysis showed that the Asn249Tyr substitution produced the effect of markedly reducing the extent of deamidation during thermoinactivation, thus suggesting that Asn249 plays a significant role in the mechanism of irreversible thermal denaturation of the archaeal ADH. Furthermore, the decrease in the activating effect by moderate concentrations of denaturants and studies with proteases and chelating agents point to an increase in structural rigidity and a tightening of structural zinc as additional factors responsible for the improved thermal resistance of the mutant enzyme.","['cyclohexanol', 'NAD+']","['cyclohexanone', 'NADH', 'H+']","['C1CCC(CC1)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['C1CCC(=O)CC1', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

The activities with the human ADH1C*2 are <10% of those found with the recombinant horse ADH1S, but higher than the activities with recombinant horse ADH1E, which has an active site very similar to human ADH1C. 5alpha-Dihydrotestosterone is a ketone and a competitive inhibitor against varied concentrations of the substrate cyclohexanone, whereas it is an uncompetitive inhibitor against ethanol or NAD(+). Such patterns are expected for the binding of the steroid as a dead-end inhibitor to the enzyme-NADH complex. Thus, it does not appear that 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone is an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme. Another dead-end inhibitor that gives uncompetitive inhibition of alcohol oxidation, 3-butylthiolane 1-oxide, is a potent inhibitor of alcohol metabolism in rats and mice.

TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated.

The chemical properties of this analog are comparable to those of β-NAD(+) with a redox potential of -324mV and a 341nm λmax for the reduced form. Both yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH) and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) catalyze the reduction of acycloNAD(+) by primary alcohols. With HLADH 1-butanol has the highest Vmax at 49% that of β-NAD(+). The primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect is greater than 3 indicating a significant contribution to the rate limiting step from cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen bond. The stereochemistry of the hydride transfer in the oxidation of stereospecifically deuterium labeled n-butanol is identical to that for the reaction with β-NAD(+). In contrast to the activity toward primary alcohols there is no detectable reduction of acycloNAD(+) by secondary alcohols with HLADH although these alcohols serve as competitive inhibitors. The net effect is that acycloNAD(+) has converted horse liver ADH from a broad spectrum alcohol dehydrogenase, capable of utilizing either primary or secondary alcohols, into an exclusively primary alcohol dehydrogenase. This is the first example of an NAD analog that alters the substrate specificity of a dehydrogenase and, like site-directed mutagenesis of proteins, establishes that modifications of the coenzyme distance from the active site can be used to alter enzyme function and substrate specificity. These and other results, including the activity with α-NADH, clearly demonstrate the promiscuity of the binding interactions between dehydrogenases and the riboside phosphate of the nicotinamide moiety, thus greatly expanding the possibilities for the design of analogs and inhibitors of specific dehydrogenases.

In the presence of the surfactant the initial reaction rates were consistently lower than in pure buffer at all the surfactant concentrations considered (0.5-50 mM). This effect is mainly due to an increase in the dissociation constant of beta-NAD(+) which reaches its maximum value (7,100 +/- 1,700 microM) at the CMC.

Moreover, a role of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the eye retinoid interconversions cannot be ascertained due to the lack of information on the kinetics with 11-cis-retinoids. We report here the kinetics of human ADH1B1, ADH1B2, ADH4, and mouse ADH1 and ADH4 with all-trans-, 7-cis-, 9-cis-, 11-cis- and 13-cis-isomers of retinol and retinal. These retinoids are substrates for all enzymes tested, except the 13-cis isomers which are not used by ADH1. In general, human and mouse ADH4 exhibit similar activity, higher than that of ADH1, while mouse ADH1 is more efficient than the homologous human enzymes. All tested ADHs use 11-cis-retinoids efficiently. ADH4 shows much higher k(cat)/K(m) values for 11-cis-retinol oxidation than for 11-cis-retinal reduction, a unique property among mammalian ADHs for any alcohol/aldehyde substrate pair. Docking simulations and the kinetic properties of the human ADH4 M141L mutant demonstrated that residue 141, in the middle region of the active site, is essential for such ADH4 specificity. The distinct kinetics of ADH4 with 11-cis-retinol, its wide specificity with retinol isomers and its immunolocalization in several retinal cell layers, including pigment epithelium, support a role of this enzyme in the various retinol oxidations that occur in the retina. Cytosolic ADH4 activity may complement the isomer-specific microsomal enzymes involved in photopigment regeneration and retinoic acid synthesis.","['ethanol', 'NAD+']","['acetaldehyde', 'NADH']","['CCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

Over the past three decades, attempts to identify the metabolizing enzymes responsible for the ADH1-independent pathway have focused on the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) and catalase, but have failed to clarify their roles in systemic alcohol metabolism. In this study, we used Adh3-null mutant mice to demonstrate that Class III ADH (ADH3), a ubiquitous enzyme of ancient origin, contributes to alcohol metabolism in vivo dose-dependently resulting in a diminution of acute alcohol intoxication. Although the ethanol oxidation activity of ADH3 in vitro is low due to its very high Km, it was found to exhibit a markedly enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward ethanol when the solution hydrophobicity of the reaction medium was increased with a hydrophobic substance. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with Nile red as a hydrophobic probe revealed a cytoplasmic solution of mouse liver cells to be much more hydrophobic than the buffer solution used for in vitro experiments. So, the in vivo contribution of high-Km ADH3 to alcohol metabolism is likely to involve activation in a hydrophobic solution.

The aim of this in vitro study was to characterize further ADH activity of some aerobic bacteria, representing the normal human colonic flora. These bacteria were earlier shown to possess high cytosolic ADH activities (Escherichia coli IH 133369, Klebsiella pneumoniae IH 35385, Klebsiella oxytoca IH 35339, Pseudomonas aeruginosa IH 35342, and Hafnia alvei IH 53227). ADHs of the tested bacteria strongly preferred NAD as a cofactor. Marked ADH activities were found in all bacteria, even at low ethanol concentrations (1.5 mM) that may occur in the colon due to bacterial fermentation. The Km for ethanol varied from 29.9 mM for K. pneumoniae to 0.06 mM for Hafnia alvei. The inhibition of ADH by 4-methylpyrazole was found to be of the competitive type in 4 of 5 bacteria, and Ki varied from 18.26 +/- 3.3 mM for Escherichia coli to 0.47 +/- 0.13 mM for K. pneumoniae. At pH 7.4, ADH activity was significantly lower than at pH 9.6 in four bacterial strains. ADH of K. oxytoca, however, showed almost equal activities at neutral pH and at 9.6. In conclusion, NAD-linked alcohol dehydrogenases of aerobic colonic bacteria possess low apparent Km's for ethanol. Accordingly, they may oxidize moderate amounts of ethanol ingested during social drinking with nearly maximal velocity. This may result in the marked production of intracolonic acetaldehyde. Kinetic characteristics of the bacterial enzymes may enable some of them to produce acetaldehyde even from endogenous ethanol formed by other bacteria via alcoholic fermentation. The microbial ADHs were inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole by the same competitive inhibition as hepatic ADH, however, with nearly 1000 times lower susceptibility. Individual variations in human colonic flora may thus contribute to the risk of alcohol-related gastrointestinal morbidity, such as diarrhea, colon polyps and cancer, and liver injury.","['ethanol', 'NAD+']","['acetaldehyde', 'NADH']","['CCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

Values of Km and kcat for all the isoenzymes, except beta 1 beta 1-ADH, were similar for the oxidation of ethanol but varied markedly for other alcohols. The kcat values for beta 1 beta 1-ADH were invariant (approximately 10 min-1) and much lower (5-15-fold) than those for any other class I isoenzyme studied. Km values for methanol and ethylene glycol were from 5- to 100-fold greater than those for ethanol, depending on the isoenzyme, while those for benzyl alcohol, octanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were usually 100-1000-fold lower than those for ethanol. The homodimer beta 1 beta 1 had the lowest kcat/Km value for all alcohols studied except methanol and ethylene glycol; kcat values were relatively constant for all isoenzymes acting on all alcohols, and, hence, specificity was manifested principally in the value of Km. Values of Km and kcat/Km revealed for all enzymes examined that the short chain alcohols are the poorest while alcohols with bulky substituents are much better substrates. The experimental values of the kinetic parameters for heterodimers deviate from the calculated average of those of their parent homodimers and, hence, cannot be predicted from the behavior of the latter. Thus, the specificities of both the hetero- and homodimeric isoenzymes of ADH toward a given substrate are characteristics of each.

Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site.

The activities with the human ADH1C*2 are <10% of those found with the recombinant horse ADH1S, but higher than the activities with recombinant horse ADH1E, which has an active site very similar to human ADH1C. 5alpha-Dihydrotestosterone is a ketone and a competitive inhibitor against varied concentrations of the substrate cyclohexanone, whereas it is an uncompetitive inhibitor against ethanol or NAD(+). Such patterns are expected for the binding of the steroid as a dead-end inhibitor to the enzyme-NADH complex. Thus, it does not appear that 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone is an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme. Another dead-end inhibitor that gives uncompetitive inhibition of alcohol oxidation, 3-butylthiolane 1-oxide, is a potent inhibitor of alcohol metabolism in rats and mice. Simulation of the kinetics of ethanol elimination in rats with varied concentrations of the inhibitor is shown to yield the in vivo inhibition constant and an estimate of the rate of elimination of the inhibitor.","['ethanol', 'NAD+']","['acetaldehyde', 'NADH']","['CCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

Moreover, a role of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the eye retinoid interconversions cannot be ascertained due to the lack of information on the kinetics with 11-cis-retinoids. We report here the kinetics of human ADH1B1, ADH1B2, ADH4, and mouse ADH1 and ADH4 with all-trans-, 7-cis-, 9-cis-, 11-cis- and 13-cis-isomers of retinol and retinal. These retinoids are substrates for all enzymes tested, except the 13-cis isomers which are not used by ADH1. In general, human and mouse ADH4 exhibit similar activity, higher than that of ADH1, while mouse ADH1 is more efficient than the homologous human enzymes. All tested ADHs use 11-cis-retinoids efficiently. ADH4 shows much higher k(cat)/K(m) values for 11-cis-retinol oxidation than for 11-cis-retinal reduction, a unique property among mammalian ADHs for any alcohol/aldehyde substrate pair. Docking simulations and the kinetic properties of the human ADH4 M141L mutant demonstrated that residue 141, in the middle region of the active site, is essential for such ADH4 specificity. The distinct kinetics of ADH4 with 11-cis-retinol, its wide specificity with retinol isomers and its immunolocalization in several retinal cell layers, including pigment epithelium, support a role of this enzyme in the various retinol oxidations that occur in the retina. Cytosolic ADH4 activity may complement the isomer-specific microsomal enzymes involved in photopigment regeneration and retinoic acid synthesis.","['ethanol', 'NAD+']","['acetaldehyde', 'NADH']","['CCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

During the biological aging of sherry wines, where yeasts have to grow on ethanol owing to the absence of glucose, this isoenzyme plays a prominent role by converting the ethanol into acetaldehyde and producing NADH in the process. Overexpression of the gene ADH2 during alcoholic fermentation has no effect on the proteomic profile or the net production of some metabolites associated with glycolysis and alcoholic fermentation such as ethanol, acetaldehyde, and glycerol. However, it affects indirectly glucose and ammonium uptakes, cell growth, and intracellular redox potential, which lead to an altered metabolome.

The enzyme activity was present in soluble and mainly in particulate material whose density was 1.105 in a sucrose gradient. By differential centrifugation, most of the ADH activity sedimented at 160,000 g (160,000-g pellet), similar to the Escherichia coli polymeric ADHE. In the Coomassie staining of the 160,000-g pellet analyzed by electrophoresis, a 96-kDa protein was more prominent than in other fractions; this band was recognized by antibodies against Lactococcus lactis ADHE. By gold labeling, the antibodies recognized the granular material that mainly constitutes the 160,000-g pellet and a material that sedimented along with the internal membrane vesicles. By negative staining, the 160,000-g fraction showed helical rodlike structures with an average length of 103 nm; almost no membrane vesicles were observed in this pellet. In internal membrane fractions, no rodlike structures were found, but protomerlike round structures were observed. These results indicate that the main amebic NAD+-dependent ADH2 activity is naturally organized as rodlike helical particles, similar to bacterial ADHE.

The other two, AA- and BB-ADH, which are most abundant in the liver, have now been purified by affinity chromatography on 4-(3-(N-(6-aminocaproyl)amino)propyl)pyrazole-sepharose and testosterone-17 beta-hemisuccinate-agarose.

Amino acid analyses show that BB-ADH is most closely related to the gamma-form of human class I ADH, whereas AA- and TT-ADH are most closely related to the beta-form of the human enzyme. BB-ADH is the only hamster ADH that is active toward sterols and sensitive to testosterone and isoflavone inhibition. These results suggest that hamster BB- and human gamma gamma-ADH also share similar catalytic properties. AA- and TT-ADH are neither active toward sterols nor sensitive to testosterone or isoflavone inhibition; thus, they are functionally different from the human alpha alpha- or gamma gamma-ADHs. Compared with AA- and BB-ADH, TT-ADH exhibits much higher Km values toward primary aliphatic alcohols and cyclohexanol. AA- and BB-ADH share similar substrate specificities toward primary aliphatic alcohols. However, they exhibit different stereospecificities for secondary alcohols. BB-ADH prefers the (R)-(-)-isomer of 2-butanol, whereas AA-ADH prefers the (S)-(-)-isomer.

Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) plays an important role in the metabolism of ethanol. Chronic alcohol administration stimulates NO formation in the liver, and production of NO is increased in alcohol liver injury. The effect of exogenous and endogenous NO on rat or horse ADH activity was evaluated. Incubation of intact rat hepatocytes or cytosol isolated from hepatocytes with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide donor, resulted in a decrease in ADH activity. Endogenous NO synthesis was induced in rat hepatocytes by incubation with a mixture of cytokines and endotoxin in the presence of L-arginine. As NO production in hepatocytes increased over a 24 h time period, a significant decrease in ADH activity was observed. This effect was blocked by the competitive inhibitor of NO synthesis, N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, indicating that ADH was also inactivated by endogenously generated NO. The decreased activity of ADH was not related to lowering of the ADH content as shown by Western blot analysis. To evaluate the mechanism of inhibition, purified ADH from equine liver was incubated with gaseous NO or NO released from NO donors such as the diethylamine/nitric oxide complex (DEA/NO) and SNAP. NO donors inactivated ADH in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Trapping of NO with hemoglobin resulted in protection of ADH against inactivation by NO. There was no effect by analogues of the NO donors which do not release NO. NAD afforded some protection against the NO inactivation of ADH. Measurements of thiol oxidation, S nitrosylation, and zinc release were used to assess the effect of NO on ADH activity. Thiol oxidation, S-nitroso thiol formation, and zinc release correlated with inactivation of ADH by NO, indicating that disruption of the zinc/thiolate active center due to S nitrosylation of ADH results in zinc release, followed by inactivation of the enzyme. Recovery experiments were performed by incubating the NO-treated enzyme with dithiothreitol (DTT) and/or Zn2+. The inhibitory effect by NO was reversible since, after the nitrosylated enzyme was reduced with DTT followed by incubation with ZnCl2 to allow reincorporation of Zn2+, ADH activity was increased from 20% of control values to 70%.

However, since a plethora of structurally related aldehydes form during membrane oxidation, clarifying the toxicological significance of individual products (e.g., CA) is challenging. To facilitate study of the mechanisms underlying CA toxicity, we explored the possibility that it can be formed enzymatically from an unsaturated precursor, crotyl alcohol. This is analogous to the way allyl alcohol is converted in vivo to its toxic oxidation product, acrolein. In kinetic studies, we found that crotyl alcohol was readily oxidized by equine liver alcohol dehydrogenase, with electrospray-mass spectrometry confirming that CA was the main product formed. Moreover, in mouse hepatocytes, crotyl alcohol produced marked time- and concentration-dependent cell killing as well as pronounced glutathione depletion. Both cytotoxicity and glutathione loss were abolished by the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole, indicating an oxidation product mediated these effects. In keeping with expectations that carbonyl-retaining Michael addition adducts would feature prominently during protein modification by CA, exposure to crotyl alcohol resulted in marked carbonylation of a wide range of cell proteins, an effect that was also abolished by 4-methylpyrazole. Damage to a subset of small proteins (e.g., 29, 32, 33 kDa) closely correlated with the severity of cell death.

Their structures were analyzed in mixture, and the two sub-sets of peptides obtained could be distinguished by evaluation of the recovery ratios within the peptide pairs. The isozymes have class-I activities, with an ethanol dehydrogenase activity of 0.6 U/mg and no formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity, have typical class-I structures, and are composed of N-terminally acetylated 375-residue subunits (a and b). Importantly, variability patterns between the isozymes are reminiscent of those both in the other two lines with isozymes (primates and horse) and in the class distinctions of the enzyme. Hence, the variability pattern since the distant stage of class-I emergence is also visible within the more recent isozyme divergence, illustrating a continuity in the evolution of isozymes to classes (and then to enzymes).

Aliphatic and alicyclic alcohols serve as substrates for this first reptilian form of the enzyme characterized, with Km values decreasing rapidly from methanol to hexanol, as for the human class I enzymes, and a Km of 1.2 mM for ethanol at pH 9.9. The N-terminus of the 374-residue protein chain is acetyl-blocked. The enzyme is related in descending order to class I > III > V > II of the structurally characterized mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases. This observation is compatible with the presence of a I/III ancestral line. Differences of the enzyme classes exceed those of the species, suggesting an early origin of the classes. Within its enzyme class, the reptilian protein is most closely related to the avian form (82% residue identities), and is closer to the human than to the amphibian form (76%, versus 69%, respectively). This establishes class I alcohol dehydrogenase as an enzyme having fairly constant rate of change during much of vertebrate evolution, approximately 10% residue differences/100 million years of separation between pairs compared. Residues interacting with the substrate and coenzyme are largely conserved. In the alligator enzyme, there are only four replacements in the substrate pocket compared with the human class I gamma subunit, and those are not known to have functional roles. These properties account for the kinetic parameters, and suggest distinct metabolic functions for the class I enzyme in vertebrates. Comparisons of the enzymes of the different vertebrate lines reveal that segment patterns are characteristic features of the class I enzymes. Three segments are 'variable', while two are 'constant', and both these types of segment are identical with those of the classes.

Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) plays an important role in the metabolism of ethanol. Chronic alcohol administration stimulates NO formation in the liver, and production of NO is increased in alcohol liver injury. The effect of exogenous and endogenous NO on rat or horse ADH activity was evaluated. Incubation of intact rat hepatocytes or cytosol isolated from hepatocytes with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide donor, resulted in a decrease in ADH activity. Endogenous NO synthesis was induced in rat hepatocytes by incubation with a mixture of cytokines and endotoxin in the presence of L-arginine. As NO production in hepatocytes increased over a 24 h time period, a significant decrease in ADH activity was observed. This effect was blocked by the competitive inhibitor of NO synthesis, N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, indicating that ADH was also inactivated by endogenously generated NO. The decreased activity of ADH was not related to lowering of the ADH content as shown by Western blot analysis. To evaluate the mechanism of inhibition, purified ADH from equine liver was incubated with gaseous NO or NO released from NO donors such as the diethylamine/nitric oxide complex (DEA/NO) and SNAP. NO donors inactivated ADH in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Trapping of NO with hemoglobin resulted in protection of ADH against inactivation by NO. There was no effect by analogues of the NO donors which do not release NO. NAD afforded some protection against the NO inactivation of ADH. Measurements of thiol oxidation, S nitrosylation, and zinc release were used to assess the effect of NO on ADH activity. Thiol oxidation, S-nitroso thiol formation, and zinc release correlated with inactivation of ADH by NO, indicating that disruption of the zinc/thiolate active center due to S nitrosylation of ADH results in zinc release, followed by inactivation of the enzyme. Recovery experiments were performed by incubating the NO-treated enzyme with dithiothreitol (DTT) and/or Zn2+. The inhibitory effect by NO was reversible since, after the nitrosylated enzyme was reduced with DTT followed by incubation with ZnCl2 to allow reincorporation of Zn2+, ADH activity was increased from 20% of control values to 70%. These results suggest that cysteine residues contained within the zinc/thiolate active center may be primary sites of NO interaction with ADH. NO may modulate the metabolism of ethanol and influence metabolic actions of ethanol via interaction with ADH.","['ethanol', 'NAD+']","['acetaldehyde', 'NADH']","['CCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

The contribution of His-51 to catalysis was studied by characterizing ADH with His-51 substituted with Gln (H51Q). The steady-state kinetic constants for ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction at pH 8 are similar for wild-type and H51Q enzymes. In contrast, the H51Q substitution significantly shifts the pH dependencies for steady-state and transient reactions and decreases by 11-fold the rate constant for the transient oxidation of ethanol at pH 8. Modest substrate deuterium isotope effects indicate that hydride transfer only partially limits the transient oxidation and turnover. Transient data show that the H51Q substitution significantly decreases the rate of isomerization of the enzyme-NAD(+) complex and becomes a limiting step for ethanol oxidation. Isomerization of the enzyme-NAD(+) complex is rate limiting for acetaldehyde reduction catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme, but release of alcohol is limiting for the H51Q enzyme. X-ray crystallography of doubly substituted His51Gln:Lys228Arg ADH complexed with NAD(+) and 2,3- or 2,4-difluorobenzyl alcohol shows that Gln-51 isosterically replaces histidine in interactions with the nicotinamide ribose of the coenzyme and that Arg-228 interacts with the adenosine monophosphate of the coenzyme without affecting the protein conformation.

In this study, we used Adh3-null mutant mice to demonstrate that Class III ADH (ADH3), a ubiquitous enzyme of ancient origin, contributes to alcohol metabolism in vivo dose-dependently resulting in a diminution of acute alcohol intoxication. Although the ethanol oxidation activity of ADH3 in vitro is low due to its very high Km, it was found to exhibit a markedly enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward ethanol when the solution hydrophobicity of the reaction medium was increased with a hydrophobic substance. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with Nile red as a hydrophobic probe revealed a cytoplasmic solution of mouse liver cells to be much more hydrophobic than the buffer solution used for in vitro experiments. So, the in vivo contribution of high-Km ADH3 to alcohol metabolism is likely to involve activation in a hydrophobic solution.

The MD-created Boltzmann distribution of htADH x NAD+ x EtO- structures establishes the formation of multiple states which increase in number with a decrease in temperature. The motions of the cofactor domain are highly correlated with the motions of NAD+ at the optimal growth temperature (348 K), with NAD+ being pushed toward the substrate by Val260. With a decrease in temperature, the motion together of the cofactor and substrate is reversed, and at 298 K, the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor moves away from the substrate.

In this study, administration of the nonvolatile fraction of whisky was found to lower the concentration of acetaldehyde in the blood of mice by depressing alcohol metabolism through the inhibition of liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Four of the 12 phenolic compounds detected in the nonvolatile fraction (caffeic acid, vanillin, syringaldehyde, ellagic acid), the amounts of which increase during the maturation of whisky, were found to strongly inhibit mouse ADH 1 (class I). Their inhibition constant values for ADH 1 were 0.08, 7.9, 15.6, and 22.0 mumol/L, respectively, whereas that for pyrazole, a well-known ADH inhibitor, was 5.1 mumol/L. The 2 phenolic aldehydes and ellagic acid exhibited a mixed type of inhibition, whereas caffeic acid showed the competitive type. When individually administered to mice together with ethanol, each of these phytophenols depressed the elimination of ethanol, thereby lowering the acetaldehyde concentration of blood. Thus, it was demonstrated that the enhanced inhibition of liver ADH 1 due to the increased amounts of these phytophenols in mature whisky caused the depression of alcohol metabolism and a consequent lowering of blood acetaldehyde level. These substances are commonly found in various food plants and act as antioxidants and/or anticarcinogens. Therefore, the intake of foods rich in them together with alcohol may not only diminish the metabolic toxicity of alcohol by reducing both the blood acetaldehyde level and oxidative stress, but also help limit the amount of alcohol a person drinks by depressing alcohol metabolism.","['ethanol', 'NAD+']","['acetaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

The exact mechanism of ethanol-associated carcinogenesis has remained unknown. The metabolism of ethanol leads to generation of acetaldehyde (AA), which is highly toxic and carcinogenic. The amount of acetaldehyde to which cells or tissues are exposed after alcohol ingestion may be of great importance and may, among others, affects carcinogenesis. Ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The enzyme responsible for oxidation of acetaldehyde is aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Both formation and degradation of acetaldehyde depends on the activity of these enzymes. The total alcohol dehydrogenase activity is significantly higher in cancer tissues than in this healthy organs (e.g. liver, stomach, esophagus, colorectum). Moreover the activity of ADH is much higher than the activity of ALDH. This suggests that cancer cells have a greater capability for ethanol oxidation but less ability to remove acetaldehyde than normal tissues. In addition significant differences of ADH isoenzymes activities between cancer tissues and healthy organs may be a factor intensifying carcinogenesis by the increased ability to acetaldehyde formation from ethanol and disorders in metabolism of some biologically important substances (e.g. retinoic acid). The changes in activity of particular ADH isoenzymes in the sera of patients with different cancers, seem to be caused by release of these isoenzymes from cancer cells, and may be useful for diagnostics of this cancer. The particular isoenzymes of ADH present in the serum may indicate the cancer localization.","['ethanol', 'NAD+']","['acetaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

Moderate pressure increases capture by activating hydride transfer, whose transition-state must therefore have a smaller volume than the free alcohol plus the capturing form of enzyme, with DeltaV(double dagger)=-30 mL mol(-1) for isopropanol. A comparison of these effects with those on the oxidation of deutero-isopropanol generates a monophasic decrease in the intrinsic isotope effect; therefore, the volume of activation for the transition-state of deuteride transfer must be even more negative, by 7.6 mL mol(-1). The pressure data extrapolate and factor the kinetic isotope effect into a semi-classical reactant-state component, with a null value of k(H)/k(D)=1, and a transition-state component of Q(H)/Q(D)=4, suggestive of hydrogen tunneling. Pressures above 1.5 kbar decrease capture by favoring a minor conformation of enzyme which binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) less tightly. This inactive conformation has a smaller volume than active E-NAD(+), with a difference of 74 mL mol(-1) and an equilibrium constant of 93 between them, at one atmosphere of pressure. These results are virtually identical to those obtained with benzyl alcohol and give credence to this method of analysis. Moreover, qualitatively similar results with greater pressure sensitivity but less precision are obtained using ethanol as a substrate, only with pressure driving the value of the isotope effect to a value less than (D)k=1.03 directly, without extrapolation.

Different effects were observed at low and high salt concentrations. At high concentrations, some salts had stabilizing effects, while others were destabilizing. The effects of salts in the high concentration range examined can be described as follows: (decreased thermal stability) NaClO(4) < NaI = (C(2)H(5))(4)NBr < NH(4)Br < NaBr = KBr = CsBr = (no addition) < (CH(3))(4)NBr < KCl < KF < Na(2)SO(4) (increased thermal stability). The decreasing effect of NaClO(4) on YADH controlled the thermal stability of the enzyme absolutely and was not compensated by the addition of Na(2)SO(4), a salt which stabilized the enzyme. However, Na(2)SO(4) compensation did occur in response to the decrease in thermal stability caused by (C(2)H(5))(4)NBr. The rate constants of inactivation by heat (k (in)) of the enzyme were measured at various temperatures. Effective values of the thermodynamic activation parameters of thermal inactivation, activation of free energy (DeltaG (double dagger)), activation enthalpy (DeltaH (double dagger)), and activation entropy (DeltaS (double dagger)), were determined.

Results from size-exclusion column chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and isothermal titration calorimetry have suggested that the mechanism of inhibition of the metalloenzyme by the antibiotics is due to the antibiotic-induced disruption of the enzyme quaternary structure. The nature of the enzyme inhibition, the binding stoichiometry of two antibiotics per monomer, and comparable dissociation constants for the antibiotic and free (or substrate-bound) ADH imply that the association occurs as a consequence of the binding of the antibiotics to Zn(II) ion present at the structural center.

NAD+ in micromolar concentration protects the enzyme against the inhibitor in an uncompetitive manner, while imidazole significantly increases the extent of the activation. Carboxymethylation selectively modifies one out of five cysteine residues per subunit, namely, Cys 38, located in the catalytic site, as determined by peptide and sequence analysis, and enhances by up to 25-fold the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Carboxymethylated SsADH is less thermostable and shows a temperature optimum 30 degrees C lower than that of the native enzyme. The carboxymethylated enzyme exhibits a lower affinity toward the oxidized and reduced coenzyme. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 are 60- and 200-fold higher, respectively, compared to the native enzyme. The significant isotope effect in alcohol oxidation suggests that hydride transfer partially limits the turnover rate of the reaction catalyzed by the modified enzyme, whereas the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme is NADH dissociation.

Despite the low level of sequence identity, the overall fold of the monomer is similar to that of the other homologous ADHs of known structure.

At the bottom of this cleft, the catalytic zinc ion is coordinated tetrahedrally and lacks the zinc-bound water molecule that is usually found in ADH apoform structures. The fourth coordination position is indeed occupied by a Glu residue, as found in bacterial tetrameric ADHs. Other differences are found in the architecture of the substrate pocket whose entrance is more restricted than in other ADHs.

Adh3 has been identified by genome BLASTP analyses using the amino acid sequence of 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase DhaT from Klebsiella pneumoniae and group III alcohol dehydrogenases with known activity towards 1,3-propanediol as target sequences. The recombinant protein was purified in a two-step column chromatography approach. Crystal structure determination and biochemical characterisation confirmed that Adh3 forms a Ni(2+)-containing homodimer in its active form. Adh3 catalyses the interconversion of ethanol and its corresponding aldehyde acetaldyhyde and is also capable of using other alcoholic compounds as substrates, such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol and 1-propanol. In the presence of Ni(2+), activity increases towards 1,3-propanediol and 1,2-propanediol. Adh3 is strictly dependent on NAD(+)/NADH, whereas no activity has been observed with NADP(+)/NADPH as co-factor. The enzyme exhibits a specific activity of 1.1 U/mg using EtOH as substrate with an optimal pH value of 9.0 for ethanol oxidation and 8.0 for aldehyde reduction.

Results obtained from isobaric mass tag-facilitated shotgun proteomics (iTRAQ) indicate that on average, 21 and 31% of the 284 proteins identified (with > or = 2 MS/MS) are increased and decreased expression in ethanol cultures compared to glucose control cultures. Preliminary analysis shows >2-fold increase of the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH-10 (SSO2536), and the putative ADH-2 (SSO0764) in both translational and transcriptional data (using quantitative RT-PCR), suggesting both proteins are integral to ethanol metabolism. Evidence that ethanol was catabolised into central metabolism via acetyl-CoA intermediates was further indicated by another >2-fold increase in protein expression levels of various acetyl-CoA synthetases. The decreased expression (>2-fold) of isocitrate dehydrogenase at the protein level suggests that the ethanol grown cultures shifted toward the glyoxylate cycle. Subsequently, the activity of ADH-2 was confirmed by overexpression in Escherichia coli, with the resultant purified in vitro enzyme exhibiting an activity that increased with temperature up to 95 degrees C, and giving a specific activity of 1.05 U/mg.","['ethanol', 'NAD+']","['acetaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

Spectrophotometric enzyme assays reveal that ADH activity in isolated mitochondria is increased approximately 16-fold by Triton X-100, which demonstrates that the enzyme is located in the matrix. Using genetic knockouts, we show conclusively that the novel mitochondrial ADH is encoded by adh4 and, as such, is unrelated to ADH isoenzymes found in mitochondria of other yeasts. By performing a modular-kinetic analysis of mitochondrial electron transfer, we furthermore show how ethanol-dependent respiratory activity (which involves oxidation of matrix-located NADH) compares with that observed when succinate or externally added NADH are used as substrates.

The equilibrium constant for HLAMe oxidation to the aldehyde (OLAMe) with NAD(+) was determined as 2.16 × 10(-3) from the kinetic parameters of the BsADH-catalyzed forward and reverse reactions.

Semi-preparative biocatalysis at 60 °C using the stabilized enzyme, employing butyraldehyde for in situ cofactor regeneration with only catalytic amounts of NAD(+), yielded up to 23 % conversion of HLAMe to OLAMe after 30 min.

Here we report the purification and characterization of an alcohol dehydrogenase (designated ADH-hT) from the novel strain LLD-R of Bacillus stearothermophilus which grows at 70 degrees C. ADH-hT was obtained in pure form by anion exchange chromatography and two affinity chromatographies, with a final yield of about 30%. ADH-hT was found to be a tetramer of 37 kDa-subunits, and to have a pI of 4.9. ADH-hT displayed a broad substrate specificity; its activity was highest for aldehydes, and decreased progressively for alcohols and ketones. ADH-hT was endowed with catalytic activity and resistance in the presence of several denaturing agents (organic solvents, detergents, chaotropic agents). ADH-hT shared with ADH 1503 (the alcohol dehydrogenase from B. stearothermophilus strain NCA 1503 which grows at 55 degrees C) the optimal temperature of 65 degrees C, but it was more resistant than ADH 1503 towards heating. In conclusion, due to its stability and broad substrate specificity ADH-hT could be utilized in bio-industrial processes.

Due to their versatile specificities, these biocatalysts are of great interest for industrial applications. The adh3-gene encoding a group III alcohol dehydrogenase was isolated from the gram-positive bacterium Oenococcus oeni and was characterised after expression in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Adh3 has been identified by genome BLASTP analyses using the amino acid sequence of 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase DhaT from Klebsiella pneumoniae and group III alcohol dehydrogenases with known activity towards 1,3-propanediol as target sequences. The recombinant protein was purified in a two-step column chromatography approach. Crystal structure determination and biochemical characterisation confirmed that Adh3 forms a Ni(2+)-containing homodimer in its active form. Adh3 catalyses the interconversion of ethanol and its corresponding aldehyde acetaldyhyde and is also capable of using other alcoholic compounds as substrates, such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol and 1-propanol. In the presence of Ni(2+), activity increases towards 1,3-propanediol and 1,2-propanediol. Adh3 is strictly dependent on NAD(+)/NADH, whereas no activity has been observed with NADP(+)/NADPH as co-factor. The enzyme exhibits a specific activity of 1.1 U/mg using EtOH as substrate with an optimal pH value of 9.0 for ethanol oxidation and 8.0 for aldehyde reduction. Moreover, Adh3 exhibits tolerance to several metal ions and organic solvents, but is completely inhibited in the presence of Zn(2+).

TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid.

Evidence that ethanol was catabolised into central metabolism via acetyl-CoA intermediates was further indicated by another >2-fold increase in protein expression levels of various acetyl-CoA synthetases. The decreased expression (>2-fold) of isocitrate dehydrogenase at the protein level suggests that the ethanol grown cultures shifted toward the glyoxylate cycle.

The archaeal ADH is chemically modified and activated in a Michaelis-Menten-type reaction, where one molecule of the reagent binds per active site. NAD+ in micromolar concentration protects the enzyme against the inhibitor in an uncompetitive manner, while imidazole significantly increases the extent of the activation. Carboxymethylation selectively modifies one out of five cysteine residues per subunit, namely, Cys 38, located in the catalytic site, as determined by peptide and sequence analysis, and enhances by up to 25-fold the oxidation rate of benzyl alcohol. Carboxymethylated SsADH is less thermostable and shows a temperature optimum 30 degrees C lower than that of the native enzyme. The carboxymethylated enzyme exhibits a lower affinity toward the oxidized and reduced coenzyme. The dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH determined at 25 degrees C and pH 8.8 are 60- and 200-fold higher, respectively, compared to the native enzyme. The significant isotope effect in alcohol oxidation suggests that hydride transfer partially limits the turnover rate of the reaction catalyzed by the modified enzyme, whereas the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme is NADH dissociation.

Purified HvADH1 and HvADH2 were compared in terms of stability and enzymatic activity over a range of pH values, salt concentrations, and temperatures. Both enzymes were haloalkaliphilic and thermoactive for the oxidative reaction and catalyzed the reductive reaction at a slightly acidic pH. While the NAD(+)-dependent HvADH1 showed a preference for short-chain alcohols and was inherently unstable, HvADH2 exhibited dual cofactor specificity, accepted a broad range of substrates, and, with respect to HvADH1, was remarkably stable.

Enzyme kinetic properties (apparent K(m), V(max), and Q(10) values) and the specificity of electron donors/acceptors for different oxidoreductases involved in pyruvate conversion to fermentation products were compared in the three strains.

It was highly thermostable with an optimal temperature of 90°C and a half-life of 4.5 h at 95°C. The apparent K(m) values for the cofactors NAD(P)(+) and NADPH were similar within a range of 66 to 127 μM. TkADH preferred secondary alcohols and accepted various ketones and aldehydes as substrates. Interestingly, the enzyme could oxidize 1-phenylethanol and its derivatives having substituents at the meta and para positions with high enantioselectivity, yielding the corresponding (R)-alcohols with optical purities of greater than 99.8% enantiomeric excess (ee). TkADH could also reduce 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone to (R)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-phenylethanol with high enantioselectivity (>99.6% ee). Furthermore, the enzyme showed high resistance to organic solvents and was particularly highly active in the presence of H2O-20% 2-propanol and H2O-50% n-hexane or n-octane.

The crystal structure of the SaADH2 NADH-bound form reveals that the enzyme is a tetramer consisting of identical 27,024-Da subunits, each composed of 255 amino acids. The enzyme has remarkable thermophilicity and thermal stability, displaying activity at temperatures up to 80 °C and a 30-min half-inactivation temperature of ∼88 °C. It also shows good tolerance to common organic solvents and a strict requirement for NAD(H) as the coenzyme. SaADH2 displays a preference for the reduction of alicyclic, bicyclic and aromatic ketones and α-ketoesters, but is poorly active on aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic alcohols, showing no activity on aldehydes. Interestingly, the enzyme catalyses the asymmetric reduction of benzil to (R)-benzoin with both excellent conversion (98 %) and optical purity (98 %) by way of an efficient in situ NADH-recycling system involving a second thermophilic ADH.

Values of Km and kcat for all the isoenzymes, except beta 1 beta 1-ADH, were similar for the oxidation of ethanol but varied markedly for other alcohols. The kcat values for beta 1 beta 1-ADH were invariant (approximately 10 min-1) and much lower (5-15-fold) than those for any other class I isoenzyme studied. Km values for methanol and ethylene glycol were from 5- to 100-fold greater than those for ethanol, depending on the isoenzyme, while those for benzyl alcohol, octanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were usually 100-1000-fold lower than those for ethanol. The homodimer beta 1 beta 1 had the lowest kcat/Km value for all alcohols studied except methanol and ethylene glycol; kcat values were relatively constant for all isoenzymes acting on all alcohols, and, hence, specificity was manifested principally in the value of Km. Values of Km and kcat/Km revealed for all enzymes examined that the short chain alcohols are the poorest while alcohols with bulky substituents are much better substrates. The experimental values of the kinetic parameters for heterodimers deviate from the calculated average of those of their parent homodimers and, hence, cannot be predicted from the behavior of the latter. Thus, the specificities of both the hetero- and homodimeric isoenzymes of ADH toward a given substrate are characteristics of each. Ethanol proved to be one of the ""poorest"" substrates examined for all class I isoenzymes which are the predominant forms of the human enzyme.

This ORF indeed encoded a protein (Yll056cp), which was grouped into the atypical subgroup 7 in the SDR family and localized to the cytoplasm.

The optimum pH and temperature of this enzyme was pH 6.5 for reduction of glycolaldehyde, furfural, formaldehyde, butyraldehyde, and propylaldehyde, and 30 °C for reduction of formaldehyde or 35 °C for reduction of glycolaldehyde, furfural, butyraldehyde, and propylaldehyde.

With HLADH 1-butanol has the highest Vmax at 49% that of β-NAD(+). The primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect is greater than 3 indicating a significant contribution to the rate limiting step from cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen bond. The stereochemistry of the hydride transfer in the oxidation of stereospecifically deuterium labeled n-butanol is identical to that for the reaction with β-NAD(+). In contrast to the activity toward primary alcohols there is no detectable reduction of acycloNAD(+) by secondary alcohols with HLADH although these alcohols serve as competitive inhibitors. The net effect is that acycloNAD(+) has converted horse liver ADH from a broad spectrum alcohol dehydrogenase, capable of utilizing either primary or secondary alcohols, into an exclusively primary alcohol dehydrogenase. This is the first example of an NAD analog that alters the substrate specificity of a dehydrogenase and, like site-directed mutagenesis of proteins, establishes that modifications of the coenzyme distance from the active site can be used to alter enzyme function and substrate specificity.

Cm-ADH1 belongs to the medium-chain zinc-binding type of ADHs and is highly similar to all ADH genes expressed in fruit isolated so far. Cm-ADH2 belongs to the short-chain type of ADHs.

Both Cm-ADH proteins are much more active as reductases with K (m)s 10-20 times lower for the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols than for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes. They both show strong preference for aliphatic aldehydes but Cm-ADH1 is capable of reducing branched aldehydes such as 3-methylbutyraldehyde, whereas Cm-ADH2 cannot.

We have studied the three beta beta isoenzymes produced at ADH2 because they exhibit very different kinetic properties and they appear with different frequencies in different racial populations. The beta 3 beta 3 isoenzyme which appears in 25% of black Americans was purified to homogeneity, and conditions were found to stabilize this labile isoenzyme. The comparison of substrate specificity among beta beta isoenzymes for primary straight-chain alcohols indicates that there is a positive correlation between Vmax/KM and the log octanol/water partition coefficient for alcohols with beta 2 beta 2 and beta 3 beta 3 but not with beta 1 beta 1. Methyl substitutions at C1 or C2 of these alcohols reduce the catalytic efficiency with all three isoenzymes. The KM and Ki values of beta 3 beta 3 for NAD+ and NADH are substantially higher than values for beta 1 beta 1 or beta 2 beta 2. The Vmax of beta 3 beta 3 ethanol oxidation is 90 times that of beta 1 beta 1. Sequencing of the beta 3 subunit and gene indicates that the polymorphism results from a single amino acid exchange of Cys-369 in beta 3 for Arg-369 in beta 1 and beta 2 [Burnell et al.

The 373-amino acid sigma-ADH encoded by this cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme for ethanol oxidation at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, calculated from active-site titration of NADH binding, was 92 +/- 9 units/mg. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site. The deletion of Gly-117 in human sigma-ADH and a substitution of Leu for the bulky Tyr-110 appear to facilitate retinol access to the active-site zinc.","['hexanol', 'NAD+']","['n-hexanal', 'NADH']","['CCCCCCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCCCCC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

One of these isozymes, TT-ADH, found only in the testes of golden hamsters was previously purified and partially characterized (Keung WM: Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 156:38-45, 1988). The other two, AA- and BB-ADH, which are most abundant in the liver, have now been purified by affinity chromatography on 4-(3-(N-(6-aminocaproyl)amino)propyl)pyrazole-sepharose and testosterone-17 beta-hemisuccinate-agarose. Hamster AA-, BB-, and TT-ADH are all homodimers of molecular weight near 80,000 and each contains 4 atoms of zinc. Amino acid analyses show that BB-ADH is most closely related to the gamma-form of human class I ADH, whereas AA- and TT-ADH are most closely related to the beta-form of the human enzyme. BB-ADH is the only hamster ADH that is active toward sterols and sensitive to testosterone and isoflavone inhibition. These results suggest that hamster BB- and human gamma gamma-ADH also share similar catalytic properties. AA- and TT-ADH are neither active toward sterols nor sensitive to testosterone or isoflavone inhibition; thus, they are functionally different from the human alpha alpha- or gamma gamma-ADHs. Compared with AA- and BB-ADH, TT-ADH exhibits much higher Km values toward primary aliphatic alcohols and cyclohexanol. AA- and BB-ADH share similar substrate specificities toward primary aliphatic alcohols. However, they exhibit different stereospecificities for secondary alcohols. BB-ADH prefers the (R)-(-)-isomer of 2-butanol, whereas AA-ADH prefers the (S)-(-)-isomer.

Aliphatic and alicyclic alcohols serve as substrates for this first reptilian form of the enzyme characterized, with Km values decreasing rapidly from methanol to hexanol, as for the human class I enzymes, and a Km of 1.2 mM for ethanol at pH 9.9. The N-terminus of the 374-residue protein chain is acetyl-blocked. The enzyme is related in descending order to class I > III > V > II of the structurally characterized mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases. This observation is compatible with the presence of a I/III ancestral line. Differences of the enzyme classes exceed those of the species, suggesting an early origin of the classes. Within its enzyme class, the reptilian protein is most closely related to the avian form (82% residue identities), and is closer to the human than to the amphibian form (76%, versus 69%, respectively). This establishes class I alcohol dehydrogenase as an enzyme having fairly constant rate of change during much of vertebrate evolution, approximately 10% residue differences/100 million years of separation between pairs compared. Residues interacting with the substrate and coenzyme are largely conserved. In the alligator enzyme, there are only four replacements in the substrate pocket compared with the human class I gamma subunit, and those are not known to have functional roles. These properties account for the kinetic parameters, and suggest distinct metabolic functions for the class I enzyme in vertebrates. Comparisons of the enzymes of the different vertebrate lines reveal that segment patterns are characteristic features of the class I enzymes. Three segments are 'variable', while two are 'constant', and both these types of segment are identical with those of the classes.

Moreover, a role of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the eye retinoid interconversions cannot be ascertained due to the lack of information on the kinetics with 11-cis-retinoids. We report here the kinetics of human ADH1B1, ADH1B2, ADH4, and mouse ADH1 and ADH4 with all-trans-, 7-cis-, 9-cis-, 11-cis- and 13-cis-isomers of retinol and retinal. These retinoids are substrates for all enzymes tested, except the 13-cis isomers which are not used by ADH1. In general, human and mouse ADH4 exhibit similar activity, higher than that of ADH1, while mouse ADH1 is more efficient than the homologous human enzymes. All tested ADHs use 11-cis-retinoids efficiently. ADH4 shows much higher k(cat)/K(m) values for 11-cis-retinol oxidation than for 11-cis-retinal reduction, a unique property among mammalian ADHs for any alcohol/aldehyde substrate pair.

Moreover, a role of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the eye retinoid interconversions cannot be ascertained due to the lack of information on the kinetics with 11-cis-retinoids. We report here the kinetics of human ADH1B1, ADH1B2, ADH4, and mouse ADH1 and ADH4 with all-trans-, 7-cis-, 9-cis-, 11-cis- and 13-cis-isomers of retinol and retinal. These retinoids are substrates for all enzymes tested, except the 13-cis isomers which are not used by ADH1. In general, human and mouse ADH4 exhibit similar activity, higher than that of ADH1, while mouse ADH1 is more efficient than the homologous human enzymes. All tested ADHs use 11-cis-retinoids efficiently. ADH4 shows much higher k(cat)/K(m) values for 11-cis-retinol oxidation than for 11-cis-retinal reduction, a unique property among mammalian ADHs for any alcohol/aldehyde substrate pair.

Initial velocity, product inhibition, and dead-end inhibition experiments were performed with the recombinant human class IV ADH to elucidate kinetic mechanism with all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal as natural substrates. Fluorescence quenching was titrated in formation of the binary and abortive ternary enzyme complexes. The minimal mechanism deduced from steady-state kinetic and equilibrium binding studies is best described as an asymmetric rapid equilibrium random mechanism with two dead-end ternary complexes for retinol oxidation and a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism with one dead-end ternary complex for retinal reduction, a unique mechanistic form for zinc-containing ADHs in the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Dissociation constants for the binary complexes as well as the productive and abortive ternary complexes determined from different experimental approaches are in reasonable agreement. Kinetic isotope effect studies suggest rate-limiting isomerization of the central ternary complexes in both reaction directions.

A comparison of these effects with those on the oxidation of deutero-isopropanol generates a monophasic decrease in the intrinsic isotope effect; therefore, the volume of activation for the transition-state of deuteride transfer must be even more negative, by 7.6 mL mol(-1). The pressure data extrapolate and factor the kinetic isotope effect into a semi-classical reactant-state component, with a null value of k(H)/k(D)=1, and a transition-state component of Q(H)/Q(D)=4, suggestive of hydrogen tunneling. Pressures above 1.5 kbar decrease capture by favoring a minor conformation of enzyme which binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) less tightly. This inactive conformation has a smaller volume than active E-NAD(+), with a difference of 74 mL mol(-1) and an equilibrium constant of 93 between them, at one atmosphere of pressure. These results are virtually identical to those obtained with benzyl alcohol and give credence to this method of analysis.

ADH-3 is the group of cathodic ADH forms, mainly present in liver, that has been the subject of the majority of the previous studies on rat ADH. The three isoenzymes have been purified to homogeneity and characterized. All of them have similar physical characteristics: Mr 80,000, with two subunits of Mr 40,000; they contain four atoms of Zn per molecule, and prefer NAD+ as cofactor.

ADH-3 exhibits a Km for ethanol of 1.4 mM, a broad substrate specificity and is strongly inhibited by pyrazole (Ki = 0.4 microM). ADH-2 shows substrate specificity toward long-chain alcohols and aldehydes, cannot be saturated by ethanol and is practically insensitive to pyrazole (Ki = 78.4 mM). ADH-1 has intermediate properties, with a Km for ethanol of 340 mM, a broad substrate specificity and Ki for pyrazole of 0.56 mM. Rat ADH-1, ADH-2 and ADH-3 exhibit many analogies with human ADH classes II, III and I respectively.

Aliphatic and alicyclic alcohols serve as substrates for this first reptilian form of the enzyme characterized, with Km values decreasing rapidly from methanol to hexanol, as for the human class I enzymes, and a Km of 1.2 mM for ethanol at pH 9.9. The N-terminus of the 374-residue protein chain is acetyl-blocked. The enzyme is related in descending order to class I > III > V > II of the structurally characterized mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases. This observation is compatible with the presence of a I/III ancestral line. Differences of the enzyme classes exceed those of the species, suggesting an early origin of the classes. Within its enzyme class, the reptilian protein is most closely related to the avian form (82% residue identities), and is closer to the human than to the amphibian form (76%, versus 69%, respectively). This establishes class I alcohol dehydrogenase as an enzyme having fairly constant rate of change during much of vertebrate evolution, approximately 10% residue differences/100 million years of separation between pairs compared. Residues interacting with the substrate and coenzyme are largely conserved. In the alligator enzyme, there are only four replacements in the substrate pocket compared with the human class I gamma subunit, and those are not known to have functional roles. These properties account for the kinetic parameters, and suggest distinct metabolic functions for the class I enzyme in vertebrates. Comparisons of the enzymes of the different vertebrate lines reveal that segment patterns are characteristic features of the class I enzymes. Three segments are 'variable', while two are 'constant', and both these types of segment are identical with those of the classes. There is extensive variability in close proximity to the active site of the enzyme and this appears to constitute a fundamental property of class I liver alcohol dehydrogenases in general.","['methanol', 'NAD+']","['formaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['CO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['C=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

Eight isoenzymes of different subunit composition (alpha gamma 2, gamma 2 gamma 2, alpha gamma 1, alpha beta 1, beta 1 gamma 2, gamma 1 gamma 1, beta 1 gamma 1, and beta 1 beta 1) were purified, and their activities were measured at pH 10.0 by using ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol, benzyl alcohol, octanol, cyclohexanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid as substrates. Values of Km and kcat for all the isoenzymes, except beta 1 beta 1-ADH, were similar for the oxidation of ethanol but varied markedly for other alcohols. The kcat values for beta 1 beta 1-ADH were invariant (approximately 10 min-1) and much lower (5-15-fold) than those for any other class I isoenzyme studied. Km values for methanol and ethylene glycol were from 5- to 100-fold greater than those for ethanol, depending on the isoenzyme, while those for benzyl alcohol, octanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were usually 100-1000-fold lower than those for ethanol. The homodimer beta 1 beta 1 had the lowest kcat/Km value for all alcohols studied except methanol and ethylene glycol; kcat values were relatively constant for all isoenzymes acting on all alcohols, and, hence, specificity was manifested principally in the value of Km. Values of Km and kcat/Km revealed for all enzymes examined that the short chain alcohols are the poorest while alcohols with bulky substituents are much better substrates. The experimental values of the kinetic parameters for heterodimers deviate from the calculated average of those of their parent homodimers and, hence, cannot be predicted from the behavior of the latter. Thus, the specificities of both the hetero- and homodimeric isoenzymes of ADH toward a given substrate are characteristics of each. Ethanol proved to be one of the ""poorest"" substrates examined for all class I isoenzymes which are the predominant forms of the human enzyme.

The beta 3 beta 3 isoenzyme which appears in 25% of black Americans was purified to homogeneity, and conditions were found to stabilize this labile isoenzyme. The comparison of substrate specificity among beta beta isoenzymes for primary straight-chain alcohols indicates that there is a positive correlation between Vmax/KM and the log octanol/water partition coefficient for alcohols with beta 2 beta 2 and beta 3 beta 3 but not with beta 1 beta 1. Methyl substitutions at C1 or C2 of these alcohols reduce the catalytic efficiency with all three isoenzymes.

The Vmax of beta 3 beta 3 ethanol oxidation is 90 times that of beta 1 beta 1.

Isoenzymes are produced in liver by five different genes, two of which are polymorphic. We have studied the three beta beta isoenzymes produced at ADH2 because they exhibit very different kinetic properties and they appear with different frequencies in different racial populations. The beta 3 beta 3 isoenzyme which appears in 25% of black Americans was purified to homogeneity, and conditions were found to stabilize this labile isoenzyme. The comparison of substrate specificity among beta beta isoenzymes for primary straight-chain alcohols indicates that there is a positive correlation between Vmax/KM and the log octanol/water partition coefficient for alcohols with beta 2 beta 2 and beta 3 beta 3 but not with beta 1 beta 1. Methyl substitutions at C1 or C2 of these alcohols reduce the catalytic efficiency with all three isoenzymes. The KM and Ki values of beta 3 beta 3 for NAD+ and NADH are substantially higher than values for beta 1 beta 1 or beta 2 beta 2. The Vmax of beta 3 beta 3 ethanol oxidation is 90 times that of beta 1 beta 1. Sequencing of the beta 3 subunit and gene indicates that the polymorphism results from a single amino acid exchange of Cys-369 in beta 3 for Arg-369 in beta 1 and beta 2 [Burnell et al.

The reaction is bimolecular, and an apparent Km cannot be discerned up to 2.3 M ethanol. The enzyme is inactive toward methanol, ethylene glycol, digitoxigenin, digoxigenin, and gitoxigenin , but alcohols with carbon chain lengths greater than four are oxidized rapidly with Km values decreasing with increasing carbon chain length.

One of these isozymes, TT-ADH, found only in the testes of golden hamsters was previously purified and partially characterized (Keung WM: Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 156:38-45, 1988). The other two, AA- and BB-ADH, which are most abundant in the liver, have now been purified by affinity chromatography on 4-(3-(N-(6-aminocaproyl)amino)propyl)pyrazole-sepharose and testosterone-17 beta-hemisuccinate-agarose. Hamster AA-, BB-, and TT-ADH are all homodimers of molecular weight near 80,000 and each contains 4 atoms of zinc. Amino acid analyses show that BB-ADH is most closely related to the gamma-form of human class I ADH, whereas AA- and TT-ADH are most closely related to the beta-form of the human enzyme. BB-ADH is the only hamster ADH that is active toward sterols and sensitive to testosterone and isoflavone inhibition. These results suggest that hamster BB- and human gamma gamma-ADH also share similar catalytic properties. AA- and TT-ADH are neither active toward sterols nor sensitive to testosterone or isoflavone inhibition; thus, they are functionally different from the human alpha alpha- or gamma gamma-ADHs. Compared with AA- and BB-ADH, TT-ADH exhibits much higher Km values toward primary aliphatic alcohols and cyclohexanol. AA- and BB-ADH share similar substrate specificities toward primary aliphatic alcohols. However, they exhibit different stereospecificities for secondary alcohols. BB-ADH prefers the (R)-(-)-isomer of 2-butanol, whereas AA-ADH prefers the (S)-(-)-isomer.

1345,285593,1.1.1.1,more,?,10366509.0,"Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (DADH) is an NAD+-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes/ketones. DADH is the member of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases family (SDR) for which the largest amount of biochemical data has been gathered during the last three decades. The crystal structures of one binary form (NAD+) and three ternary complexes with NAD+.acetone, NAD+.3-pentanone and NAD+.cyclohexanone were solved at 2.4, 2.2, 1. 4 and 1.6 A resolution, respectively. From the molecular interactions observed, the reaction mechanism could be inferred. The structure of DADH undergoes a conformational change in order to bind the coenzyme. Furthermore, upon binding of the ketone, a region that was disordered in the apo form (186-191) gets stabilized and closes the active site cavity by creating either a small helix (NAD+. acetone, NAD+.3-pentanone) or an ordered loop (NAD+.cyclohexanone). The active site pocket comprises a hydrophobic bifurcated cavity which explains why the enzyme is more efficient in oxidizing secondary aliphatic alcohols (preferably R form) than primary ones. Difference Fourier maps showed that the ketone inhibitor molecule has undergone a covalent reaction with the coenzyme in all three ternary complexes. Due to the presence of the positively charged ring of the coenzyme (NAD+) and the residue Lys155, the amino acid Tyr151 is in its deprotonated (tyrosinate) state at physiological pH. Tyr151 can subtract a proton from the enolic form of the ketone and catalyze a nucleophilic attack of the Calphaatom to the C4 position of the coenzyme creating an NAD-ketone adduct. The binding of these NAD-ketone adducts to DADH accounts for the inactivation of the enzyme. The catalytic reaction proceeds in a similar way, involving the same amino acids as in the formation of the NAD-ketone adduct. The p Kavalue of 9-9.5 obtained by kinetic measurements on apo DADH can be assigned to a protonated Tyr151 which is converted to an unprotonated tyrosinate (p Ka7.6) by the influence of the positively charged nicotinamide ring in the binary enzyme-NAD+form. pH independence during the release of NADH from the binary complex enzyme-NADH can be explained by either a lack of electrostatic interaction between the coenzyme and Tyr151 or an apparent p Kavalue for this residue higher than 10.0.",['more'],['?'],[],[]

The study was focused at the level of the aroma volatile-related enzymes, including alcohol acyltransferase (AAT), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and lipoxygenase (LOX) and at the level of amino acids and fatty acids as aroma volatile precursors in peel and flesh tissues. In general, volatile production, enzyme activity levels, and precursor availability were higher in the peel than the flesh and were differentially affected by ethylene regulation. AAT enzyme activity showed a clear pattern concomitant with ethylene regulation. Contrarily, ADH and LOX seem to be independent of ethylene modulation. Isoleucine, an important precursor of aroma compounds including 2-methylbutanoate esters, showed a major increase in the peel during ripening and responded significantly to ethylene regulation. Other important aroma volatiles precursors, like linoleic and linolenic acid, showed an accumulation during ripening associated with increases in aldehydes. The significance of these changes in relation to aroma volatile production is discussed.",['more'],['?'],[],[]

Two highly divergent ADH genes (15% identity at the amino acid level) of Cantaloupe Charentais melon (Cucumis melo var. Cantalupensis) have been isolated. Cm-ADH1 belongs to the medium-chain zinc-binding type of ADHs and is highly similar to all ADH genes expressed in fruit isolated so far. Cm-ADH2 belongs to the short-chain type of ADHs. The two encoded proteins are enzymatically active upon expression in yeast. Cm-ADH1 has strong preference for NAPDH as a co-factor, whereas Cm-ADH2 preferentially uses NADH. Both Cm-ADH proteins are much more active as reductases with K (m)s 10-20 times lower for the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols than for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes. They both show strong preference for aliphatic aldehydes but Cm-ADH1 is capable of reducing branched aldehydes such as 3-methylbutyraldehyde, whereas Cm-ADH2 cannot. Both Cm-ADH genes are expressed specifically in fruit and up-regulated during ripening. Gene expression as well as total ADH activity are strongly inhibited in antisense ACC oxidase melons and in melon fruit treated with the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), indicating a positive regulation by ethylene. These data suggest that each of the Cm-ADH protein plays a specific role in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis in melon fruit.",['more'],['?'],[],[]

Moderate pressure increases capture by activating hydride transfer, whose transition-state must therefore have a smaller volume than the free alcohol plus the capturing form of enzyme, with DeltaV(double dagger)=-30 mL mol(-1) for isopropanol. A comparison of these effects with those on the oxidation of deutero-isopropanol generates a monophasic decrease in the intrinsic isotope effect; therefore, the volume of activation for the transition-state of deuteride transfer must be even more negative, by 7.6 mL mol(-1). The pressure data extrapolate and factor the kinetic isotope effect into a semi-classical reactant-state component, with a null value of k(H)/k(D)=1, and a transition-state component of Q(H)/Q(D)=4, suggestive of hydrogen tunneling. Pressures above 1.5 kbar decrease capture by favoring a minor conformation of enzyme which binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) less tightly. This inactive conformation has a smaller volume than active E-NAD(+), with a difference of 74 mL mol(-1) and an equilibrium constant of 93 between them, at one atmosphere of pressure. These results are virtually identical to those obtained with benzyl alcohol and give credence to this method of analysis. Moreover, qualitatively similar results with greater pressure sensitivity but less precision are obtained using ethanol as a substrate, only with pressure driving the value of the isotope effect to a value less than (D)k=1.03 directly, without extrapolation. The ethanol data verify the most surprising finding of these studies, namely that the entire kinetic isotope effect arises from a transition-state phenomenon.",['more'],['?'],[],[]

The amino acid sequence of HpADH3 shares over 70% of its identity with the alcohol dehydrogenases of other yeasts and exhibits the highest similarity of 91% with the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 of H. polymorpha. However, unlike the cytosolic HpADH1, HpADH3 appears to be a mitochondrial enzyme, as a mitochondrial targeting extension exists at its N terminus. The recombinant HpADH3 overexpressed in Escherichia coli showed similar catalytic efficiencies for ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction. The HpADH3 displayed substrate specificities with clear preferences for medium chain length primary alcohols and acetaldehyde for an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction, respectively. Although the H. polymorpha ADH3 gene was induced by ethanol in the culture medium, both an ADH isozyme pattern analysis and an ADH activity assay indicated that HpADH3 is not the major ADH in H. polymorpha DL-1. Moreover, HpADH3 deletion did not affect the cell growth on different carbon sources. However, when the HpADH3 mutant was complemented by an HpADH3 expression cassette fused to a strong constitutive promoter, the resulting strain produced a significantly increased amount of ethanol compared to the wild-type strain in a glucose medium. In contrast, in a xylose medium, the ethanol production was dramatically reduced in an HpADH3 overproduction strain compared to that in the wild-type strain. Taken together, our results suggest that the expression of HpADH3 would be an ideal engineering target to develop H. polymorpha as a substrate specific bioethanol production strain.",['more'],['?'],[],[]

The adh3-gene encoding a group III alcohol dehydrogenase was isolated from the gram-positive bacterium Oenococcus oeni and was characterised after expression in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Adh3 has been identified by genome BLASTP analyses using the amino acid sequence of 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase DhaT from Klebsiella pneumoniae and group III alcohol dehydrogenases with known activity towards 1,3-propanediol as target sequences. The recombinant protein was purified in a two-step column chromatography approach. Crystal structure determination and biochemical characterisation confirmed that Adh3 forms a Ni(2+)-containing homodimer in its active form. Adh3 catalyses the interconversion of ethanol and its corresponding aldehyde acetaldyhyde and is also capable of using other alcoholic compounds as substrates, such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol and 1-propanol. In the presence of Ni(2+), activity increases towards 1,3-propanediol and 1,2-propanediol.

The ht-W87A mutation results in a loss of the Arrhenius break seen at 30 °C for the wild-type enzyme and an increase in cold lability that is attributed to destabilization of the active tetrameric form. Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are nearly temperature-independent over the experimental temperature range, and similar in magnitude to those measured above 30 °C for the wild-type enzyme. This suggests that the rigidification in the wild-type enzyme below 30 °C does not occur for ht-W87A. A mutation at the dimer-dimer interface in a thermolabile psychrophilic homologue of ht-ADH, ps-A25Y, leads to a more thermostable enzyme and a change in the rate-determining step at low temperature. The reciprocal mutation in ht-ADH, ht-Y25A, results in kinetic behavior similar to that of W87A.

The convex Arrhenius curves previously reported for ht-ADH (Kohen, A., Cannio, R., Bartolucci, S., and Klinman, J. P.

The activities of these enzymes are elevated in the serum during the course of alcoholism or cirrhosis. In previous investigations we have found elevated levels of ADH, ALDH, and class I ADH activity in liver cancer cells. It can suggest that these changes may be reflected by enzyme activity in the serum. In this work, the activity of ADH isoenzymes, and ALDH in the sera of patients with liver cancer was measured. Serum samples were taken from 64 patients (28 drinkers, 36 nondrinkers), with liver cancer. 25 patients had primary and 39 metastatic liver tumors. Total ADH activity was measured by photometric method with p-nitrosodimethylaniline (NDMA) as a substrate and ALDH activity by the fluorimetric method with 6-methoxy-2-naphtaldehyde as a substrate. For the measurement of the activity of class I and II isoenzymes we employed the fluorimetric methods, with class-specific fluorogenic substrates. The activity of class III ADH was measured by the photometric method with formaldehyde and class IV with m-nitrobenzaldehyde as a substrate. A statistically significant increase of class I ADH isoenzymes was found in the sera of cancer patients. The median activity of this class isoenzyme in the total cancer group increased about 51% (2.94 mU/L) in the comparison to the control level (1.43 mU/L). The activity of the class I ADH isoenzyme was significantly higher in the sera of patients with metastatic tumors than with primary cancers. The activity of this class in the sera of drinkers and group of moderate drinkers was significantly higher in comparison to the control group and higher in the sera of heavy drinkers when compared with moderate drinking patients. The total ADH activity was significantly higher (44%) among patients with cancer than healthy ones. The activity of class I ADH isoenzymes was elevated only in the serum of patients with metastatic liver cancer.

Recombinant BsADH was produced in Escherichia coli as a homogeneous tetrameric enzyme and showed high activity towards the industrially relevant substrate ω-hydroxy lauric acid methyl ester (HLAMe) with K M = 86 μM and 44 U mg(-1). The equilibrium constant for HLAMe oxidation to the aldehyde (OLAMe) with NAD(+) was determined as 2.16 × 10(-3) from the kinetic parameters of the BsADH-catalyzed forward and reverse reactions. Since BsADH displayed limited stability under oxidizing conditions, the predominant oxidation-prone residue Cys257 was mutated to Leu based on sequence homology with related enzymes and computational simulation. This substitution resulted in an improved BsADH variant exhibiting prolonged stability and an elevated inactivation temperature. Semi-preparative biocatalysis at 60 °C using the stabilized enzyme, employing butyraldehyde for in situ cofactor regeneration with only catalytic amounts of NAD(+), yielded up to 23 % conversion of HLAMe to OLAMe after 30 min. In contrast to other oxidoreductases, no overoxidation to the dodecanoic diacid monomethyl ester was detected. Thus, the mutated BsADH offers a promising biocatalyst for the selective oxidation of fatty alcohols to yield intermediates for industrial polymer production.

The contribution of His-51 to catalysis was studied by characterizing ADH with His-51 substituted with Gln (H51Q). The steady-state kinetic constants for ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction at pH 8 are similar for wild-type and H51Q enzymes. In contrast, the H51Q substitution significantly shifts the pH dependencies for steady-state and transient reactions and decreases by 11-fold the rate constant for the transient oxidation of ethanol at pH 8. Modest substrate deuterium isotope effects indicate that hydride transfer only partially limits the transient oxidation and turnover. Transient data show that the H51Q substitution significantly decreases the rate of isomerization of the enzyme-NAD(+) complex and becomes a limiting step for ethanol oxidation. Isomerization of the enzyme-NAD(+) complex is rate limiting for acetaldehyde reduction catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme, but release of alcohol is limiting for the H51Q enzyme. X-ray crystallography of doubly substituted His51Gln:Lys228Arg ADH complexed with NAD(+) and 2,3- or 2,4-difluorobenzyl alcohol shows that Gln-51 isosterically replaces histidine in interactions with the nicotinamide ribose of the coenzyme and that Arg-228 interacts with the adenosine monophosphate of the coenzyme without affecting the protein conformation.

Values of Km and kcat for all the isoenzymes, except beta 1 beta 1-ADH, were similar for the oxidation of ethanol but varied markedly for other alcohols. The kcat values for beta 1 beta 1-ADH were invariant (approximately 10 min-1) and much lower (5-15-fold) than those for any other class I isoenzyme studied. Km values for methanol and ethylene glycol were from 5- to 100-fold greater than those for ethanol, depending on the isoenzyme, while those for benzyl alcohol, octanol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were usually 100-1000-fold lower than those for ethanol. The homodimer beta 1 beta 1 had the lowest kcat/Km value for all alcohols studied except methanol and ethylene glycol; kcat values were relatively constant for all isoenzymes acting on all alcohols, and, hence, specificity was manifested principally in the value of Km. Values of Km and kcat/Km revealed for all enzymes examined that the short chain alcohols are the poorest while alcohols with bulky substituents are much better substrates. The experimental values of the kinetic parameters for heterodimers deviate from the calculated average of those of their parent homodimers and, hence, cannot be predicted from the behavior of the latter.

Aliphatic and alicyclic alcohols serve as substrates for this first reptilian form of the enzyme characterized, with Km values decreasing rapidly from methanol to hexanol, as for the human class I enzymes, and a Km of 1.2 mM for ethanol at pH 9.9. The N-terminus of the 374-residue protein chain is acetyl-blocked. The enzyme is related in descending order to class I > III > V > II of the structurally characterized mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases. This observation is compatible with the presence of a I/III ancestral line. Differences of the enzyme classes exceed those of the species, suggesting an early origin of the classes. Within its enzyme class, the reptilian protein is most closely related to the avian form (82% residue identities), and is closer to the human than to the amphibian form (76%, versus 69%, respectively). This establishes class I alcohol dehydrogenase as an enzyme having fairly constant rate of change during much of vertebrate evolution, approximately 10% residue differences/100 million years of separation between pairs compared. Residues interacting with the substrate and coenzyme are largely conserved. In the alligator enzyme, there are only four replacements in the substrate pocket compared with the human class I gamma subunit, and those are not known to have functional roles. These properties account for the kinetic parameters, and suggest distinct metabolic functions for the class I enzyme in vertebrates. Comparisons of the enzymes of the different vertebrate lines reveal that segment patterns are characteristic features of the class I enzymes. Three segments are 'variable', while two are 'constant', and both these types of segment are identical with those of the classes. There is extensive variability in close proximity to the active site of the enzyme and this appears to constitute a fundamental property of class I liver alcohol dehydrogenases in general.","['octan-1-ol', 'NAD+']","['n-octanal', 'NADH']","['CCCCCCCCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCCCCCCC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

This zone was located on the cathode side of the origin. Incubation of D. lebanonensis Adh with NAD+ and acetone altered the electrophoretic pattern to more anodal migrating zones. D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting. Pyrazole was an ethanol-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The difference spectra of the enzyme-NAD+-pyrazole complex gave an absorption peak at 305 nm with epsilon 305 14.5 X 10(3) M-1 X cm-1. Concentrations and amounts of active enzyme can thus be determined. A kinetic rate assay to determine the concentration of enzyme active sites is also presented. This has been developed from active site concentrations established by titration at 305 nm of the enzyme and pyrazole with NAD+.

A combined evaluation of steady-state kinetic data and rate constants obtained from stopped-flow measurements, allowed the determination of all rate constants of the following ordered bi-bi mechanism: E in equilibrium E.NAD in equilibrium E.NAD.R1R2 CHOH in equilibrium E.NADH.R1R2CO in equilibrium E.NADH in equilibrium E. 3. On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4. The observed enantioselectivity implies the existence of two productive ternary complexes; E.NADH.(pro-S) 2-butanone and E.NADH.(pro-R) 2-butanone. All rate constants describing the kinetic pathways of the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone have been determined. These data have been used to estimate the expected enantiomer product composition of 2-butanone reductions using apparent kcat/Km values for the two different ternary-complex configurations of 2-butanone. Additionally, these data have been used for computer simulations of the corresponding reaction cycles. Calculated, simulated and experimental data were found to be in good agreement. Thus, the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone is the first example of a LADH-catalyzed reaction for which the stereochemical course could be described in terms of rate constants of the underlying mechanism. 5. The effects of Co(II) substitution on the different steps of the kinetic pathway have been investigated. The free energy of activation is higher for alcohol oxidation and lower for ketone reduction when catalyzed by Co(II)LADH in comparison to Zn(II)LADH. However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors. In this regard, the interactions of substrate molecules with the protein moiety are dominant over the interactions with the catalytic metal ion.","['octan-2-ol', 'NAD+']","['octan-2-one', 'NADH']","['CCCCCCC(C)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCCCCCC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

Within the ADH2 class, the rodent enzymes form a subgroup that exhibits low catalytic activity with all substrates that were examined, as compared to other groups, such as human ADH2. The low activity can be ascribed to the rigid nature of the proline residue at position 47 as the activity can be increased by approximately 100-fold by substituting Pro47 with either His (as found in human ADH2), Ala, or Gln. Mouse ADH2 follows an ordered bi-bi mechanism, and hydride transfer is rate-limiting for oxidation of benzyl alcohols catalyzed by the mutated and wild-type enzymes. Structural studies suggest that the mouse enzyme with His47 has a more closed active site, as compared to the enzyme with Pro47, and hydride transfer can be more efficient. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by all forms of the enzyme is strongly pH dependent, with pK values in the range of 8.1-9.3 for turnover numbers and catalytic efficiency. These pK values probably correspond to the ionization of the zinc-bound water or alcohol. The pK values are not lowered by the Pro47 to His substitution, suggesting that His47 does not act as a catalytic base in the deprotonation of the zinc ligand.","['octanol', 'NAD+']","['octanal', 'NADH']","['CCCCCCCCO', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCCCCCCC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

By oxidation of HMGSH, the spontaneous glutathione adduct of formaldehyde, ADH3 is implicated in the detoxification of formaldehyde. Through the GSNO reductase activity, ADH3 can affect the transnitrosation equilibrium between GSNO and S-nitrosated proteins, arguing for an important role in NO homeostasis.

Thermostability was assayed by activity measurements and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results showed that the 308Val substitution decreases protein stability, as compared to the Ile308 variant, an effect also demonstrated during prolonged storage. Ethanol, octanol, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid and all-trans retinol were used as model substrates and, generally, slightly higher Km values were observed with Val at position 308. Finally, homology modelling, from mouse ADH2, further supported the decreased stability of the Val308 variant and located position 308 in the subunit interface of the molecule and in the vicinity of the active-site pocket entrance.

Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated.

These isozymes also showed broad substrate specificities as aldehyde reductases. In contrast, B2 showed no detectable activity as an aldehyde reductase for the aldehydes examined, and used ethanol as substrate only at very high concentrations (greater than 0.5 M). The isozyme exhibited low Km and high Vmax values, however, with medium-chain alcohols. Immunological studies showed that A2 was immunologically distinct from the B2 and C2 isozymes.

The exact mechanism of ethanol-associated carcinogenesis has remained unknown. The metabolism of ethanol leads to generation of acetaldehyde (AA), which is highly toxic and carcinogenic. The amount of acetaldehyde to which cells or tissues are exposed after alcohol ingestion may be of great importance and may, among others, affects carcinogenesis. Ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The enzyme responsible for oxidation of acetaldehyde is aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Both formation and degradation of acetaldehyde depends on the activity of these enzymes. The total alcohol dehydrogenase activity is significantly higher in cancer tissues than in this healthy organs (e.g. liver, stomach, esophagus, colorectum). Moreover the activity of ADH is much higher than the activity of ALDH. This suggests that cancer cells have a greater capability for ethanol oxidation but less ability to remove acetaldehyde than normal tissues. In addition significant differences of ADH isoenzymes activities between cancer tissues and healthy organs may be a factor intensifying carcinogenesis by the increased ability to acetaldehyde formation from ethanol and disorders in metabolism of some biologically important substances (e.g. retinoic acid). The changes in activity of particular ADH isoenzymes in the sera of patients with different cancers, seem to be caused by release of these isoenzymes from cancer cells, and may be useful for diagnostics of this cancer. The particular isoenzymes of ADH present in the serum may indicate the cancer localization.","['p-nitrobenzaldehyde', 'NADH', 'H+']","['p-nitrobenzyl alcohol', 'NAD+']","['C1=CC(=CC=C1C=O)[N+](=O)[O-]', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']","['C1=CC(=CC=C1CO)[N+](=O)[O-]', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

ADH-hT was obtained in pure form by anion exchange chromatography and two affinity chromatographies, with a final yield of about 30%. ADH-hT was found to be a tetramer of 37 kDa-subunits, and to have a pI of 4.9. ADH-hT displayed a broad substrate specificity; its activity was highest for aldehydes, and decreased progressively for alcohols and ketones. ADH-hT was endowed with catalytic activity and resistance in the presence of several denaturing agents (organic solvents, detergents, chaotropic agents). ADH-hT shared with ADH 1503 (the alcohol dehydrogenase from B. stearothermophilus strain NCA 1503 which grows at 55 degrees C) the optimal temperature of 65 degrees C, but it was more resistant than ADH 1503 towards heating. In conclusion, due to its stability and broad substrate specificity ADH-hT could be utilized in bio-industrial processes.

This zone was located on the cathode side of the origin. Incubation of D. lebanonensis Adh with NAD+ and acetone altered the electrophoretic pattern to more anodal migrating zones. D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting.

A combined evaluation of steady-state kinetic data and rate constants obtained from stopped-flow measurements, allowed the determination of all rate constants of the following ordered bi-bi mechanism: E in equilibrium E.NAD in equilibrium E.NAD.R1R2 CHOH in equilibrium E.NADH.R1R2CO in equilibrium E.NADH in equilibrium E. 3. On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4. The observed enantioselectivity implies the existence of two productive ternary complexes; E.NADH.(pro-S) 2-butanone and E.NADH.(pro-R) 2-butanone. All rate constants describing the kinetic pathways of the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone have been determined. These data have been used to estimate the expected enantiomer product composition of 2-butanone reductions using apparent kcat/Km values for the two different ternary-complex configurations of 2-butanone. Additionally, these data have been used for computer simulations of the corresponding reaction cycles. Calculated, simulated and experimental data were found to be in good agreement. Thus, the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone is the first example of a LADH-catalyzed reaction for which the stereochemical course could be described in terms of rate constants of the underlying mechanism. 5. The effects of Co(II) substitution on the different steps of the kinetic pathway have been investigated. The free energy of activation is higher for alcohol oxidation and lower for ketone reduction when catalyzed by Co(II)LADH in comparison to Zn(II)LADH. However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors.

A combined evaluation of steady-state kinetic data and rate constants obtained from stopped-flow measurements, allowed the determination of all rate constants of the following ordered bi-bi mechanism: E in equilibrium E.NAD in equilibrium E.NAD.R1R2 CHOH in equilibrium E.NADH.R1R2CO in equilibrium E.NADH in equilibrium E. 3. On the basis of the different substrate specificities of LADH and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), a procedure has been developed to evaluate the enantiomeric product composition of ketone reductions. 2-Butanone and 2-pentanone reductions revealed (S)-2-butanol (86%) and (S)-2-pentanol (95%) as the major products. 4. The observed enantioselectivity implies the existence of two productive ternary complexes; E.NADH.(pro-S) 2-butanone and E.NADH.(pro-R) 2-butanone. All rate constants describing the kinetic pathways of the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone have been determined. These data have been used to estimate the expected enantiomer product composition of 2-butanone reductions using apparent kcat/Km values for the two different ternary-complex configurations of 2-butanone. Additionally, these data have been used for computer simulations of the corresponding reaction cycles. Calculated, simulated and experimental data were found to be in good agreement. Thus, the system (S)-2-butanol, (R)-2-butanol/2-butanone is the first example of a LADH-catalyzed reaction for which the stereochemical course could be described in terms of rate constants of the underlying mechanism. 5. The effects of Co(II) substitution on the different steps of the kinetic pathway have been investigated. The free energy of activation is higher for alcohol oxidation and lower for ketone reduction when catalyzed by Co(II)LADH in comparison to Zn(II)LADH. However, the free energies of binding are affected by metal substitution in such a way that the enantioselectivity of ketone reduction is not significantly changed by the substitution of Co(II) for Zn(II). 6. Evaluation of the data shows that substrate specificity and stereoselectivity result from combination of the free energies of binding and activation, with differences in binding energies as the dominating factors.

Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site.

Similarly, the substrate specificity of the pyrazole-insensitive form is more limited and its Km for ethanol (4 mM at pH 7.5) and acetaldehyde (11 mM at pH 7.0) is larger than that of the pyrazole-sensitive isoenzymes. However, their physicochemical and compositional characteristics, i.e., molecular weight, zinc content, and dimeric structure, are all virtually identical with those of other mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases studied thus far. Zinc is essential for the enzymatic function of both molecular forms as demonstrated by inhibition with chelating agents.","['pentanal', 'NAD+']","['pentanone', 'NADH']","['CCCCC=O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['CCCC(=O)C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

Zinc analyses and 1,10-phenanthroline inhibition studies indicated that the A and C subunits each contained two atoms of zinc, with at least one being involved catalytically, whereas the B subunit probably contained a single non-catalytic zinc atom. The isozymes exhibited widely divergent kinetic characteristics. A2 exhibited a Km value for ethanol of 0.15 mM and a broad substrate specificity, with Km values decreasing dramatically with an increase in chain length; C2 also exhibited this broad specificity for alcohols but showed a Km value of 232 mM for ethanol. These isozymes also showed broad substrate specificities as aldehyde reductases. In contrast, B2 showed no detectable activity as an aldehyde reductase for the aldehydes examined, and used ethanol as substrate only at very high concentrations (greater than 0.5 M). The isozyme exhibited low Km and high Vmax values, however, with medium-chain alcohols. Immunological studies showed that A2 was immunologically distinct from the B2 and C2 isozymes.

The amino acid sequence of ScbADH1 differs at four positions as compared to SceADH1, including substitutions of two glutamine residues with glutamic acid residues, and has the same sequence as the commercial yeast enzyme, which apparently is prepared from S. carlsbergensis. The electrophoretic mobilities of ScbADH1, SceADH2 and commercial ADH are similar. The kinetics and specificities of ScbADH1 and SceADH1 acting on branched, long-chain and benzyl alcohols are very similar, but the catalytic efficiency of SceADH2 is about 10-100-fold higher on these substrates. A three-dimensional structure of SceADH1 shows that the substrate binding pocket has Met-270, whereas SceADH2 has Leu-270, which allows larger substrates to bind.

TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated.

D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting.

The primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect is greater than 3 indicating a significant contribution to the rate limiting step from cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen bond. The stereochemistry of the hydride transfer in the oxidation of stereospecifically deuterium labeled n-butanol is identical to that for the reaction with β-NAD(+). In contrast to the activity toward primary alcohols there is no detectable reduction of acycloNAD(+) by secondary alcohols with HLADH although these alcohols serve as competitive inhibitors. The net effect is that acycloNAD(+) has converted horse liver ADH from a broad spectrum alcohol dehydrogenase, capable of utilizing either primary or secondary alcohols, into an exclusively primary alcohol dehydrogenase.

Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting.

TADH is a NAD(H)-dependent enzyme and shows a very broad substrate spectrum producing exclusively the (S)-enantiomer in high enantiomeric excess (>99%) during asymmetric reduction of ketones. TADH is active in the presence of 10% (v/v) water-miscible solvents like 2-propanol or acetone, which permits the use of these solvents as sacrificial substrates in substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration approaches. Furthermore, the presence of a second phase of a water-insoluble solvent like hexane or octane had only minor effects on the enzyme, which retained 80% of its activity, allowing the use of these solvents in aqueous/organic mixtures to increase the availability of low-water soluble substrates. A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated. This reaction usually proceeds without net change of the NAD(+)/NADH concentration, leading to equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acid.

Recently, several open reading frames (ORFs) were characterized as intermediate SDR aldehyde reductase genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, no functional protein in the atypical group has been characterized in S. cerevisiae till now. Herein, we report that an uncharacterized ORF YLL056C from S. cerevisiae was significantly upregulated under high furfural (2-furaldehyde) or 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde concentrations, and transcription factors Yap1p, Hsf1p, Pdr1/3p, Yrr1p, and Stb5p likely controlled its upregulated transcription. This ORF indeed encoded a protein (Yll056cp), which was grouped into the atypical subgroup 7 in the SDR family and localized to the cytoplasm. Enzyme activity assays showed that Yll056cp is not a quinone or ketone reductase but an NADH-dependent aldehyde reductase, which can reduce at least seven aldehyde compounds. This enzyme showed the best Vmax, Kcat, and Kcat/Km to glycolaldehyde, but the highest affinity (Km) to formaldehyde. The optimum pH and temperature of this enzyme was pH 6.5 for reduction of glycolaldehyde, furfural, formaldehyde, butyraldehyde, and propylaldehyde, and 30 °C for reduction of formaldehyde or 35 °C for reduction of glycolaldehyde, furfural, butyraldehyde, and propylaldehyde. Temperature and pH affected stability of this enzyme and this influence varied with aldehyde substrate. Metal ions, salts, and chemical protective additives, especially at high concentrations, had different influence on enzyme activities for reduction of different aldehydes.

The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme for ethanol oxidation at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, calculated from active-site titration of NADH binding, was 92 +/- 9 units/mg. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site. The deletion of Gly-117 in human sigma-ADH and a substitution of Leu for the bulky Tyr-110 appear to facilitate retinol access to the active-site zinc.","['propanol', 'NADH']","['propionaldehyde', 'NADH']","['CCCO', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']","['CCC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

This zone was located on the cathode side of the origin. Incubation of D. lebanonensis Adh with NAD+ and acetone altered the electrophoretic pattern to more anodal migrating zones. D. lebanonensis Adh has an Mr of 56,000, a subunit of Mr of 28 000 and is a dimer with two active sites per enzyme molecule. This agrees with a polypeptide chain of 247 residues. Metal analysis by plasma emission spectroscopy indicated that this insect alcohol dehydrogenase is not a metalloenzyme. In studies of the substrate specificity and stereospecificity, D. lebanonensis Adh was more active with secondary than with primary alcohols. Both alkyl groups in the secondary alcohols interacted hydrophobically with the alcohol binding region of the active site. The catalytic centre activity for propan-2-ol was 7.4 s-1 and the maximum velocity of most secondary alcohols was approximately the same and indicative of rate-limiting enzyme-coenzyme dissociation. For primary alcohols the maximum velocity varied and was much lower than for secondary alcohols. The catalytic centre activity for ethanol was 2.4 s-1. With [2H6]ethanol a primary kinetic 2H isotope effect of 2.8 indicated that the interconversion of the ternary complexes was rate-limiting. Pyrazole was an ethanol-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The difference spectra of the enzyme-NAD+-pyrazole complex gave an absorption peak at 305 nm with epsilon 305 14.5 X 10(3) M-1 X cm-1. Concentrations and amounts of active enzyme can thus be determined. A kinetic rate assay to determine the concentration of enzyme active sites is also presented. This has been developed from active site concentrations established by titration at 305 nm of the enzyme and pyrazole with NAD+. In contrast with the amino acid composition, which indicated that D. lebanonensis Adh and the D. melanogaster alleloenzymes were not closely related, the enzymological studies showed that their active sites were similar although differing markedly from those of zinc alcohol dehydrogenases.","['propanol', 'NADH']","['propionaldehyde', 'NADH']","['CCCO', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']","['CCC=O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']"

The exact mechanism of ethanol-associated carcinogenesis has remained unknown. The metabolism of ethanol leads to generation of acetaldehyde (AA), which is highly toxic and carcinogenic. The amount of acetaldehyde to which cells or tissues are exposed after alcohol ingestion may be of great importance and may, among others, affects carcinogenesis. Ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The enzyme responsible for oxidation of acetaldehyde is aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Both formation and degradation of acetaldehyde depends on the activity of these enzymes. The total alcohol dehydrogenase activity is significantly higher in cancer tissues than in this healthy organs (e.g. liver, stomach, esophagus, colorectum). Moreover the activity of ADH is much higher than the activity of ALDH. This suggests that cancer cells have a greater capability for ethanol oxidation but less ability to remove acetaldehyde than normal tissues. In addition significant differences of ADH isoenzymes activities between cancer tissues and healthy organs may be a factor intensifying carcinogenesis by the increased ability to acetaldehyde formation from ethanol and disorders in metabolism of some biologically important substances (e.g. retinoic acid). The changes in activity of particular ADH isoenzymes in the sera of patients with different cancers, seem to be caused by release of these isoenzymes from cancer cells, and may be useful for diagnostics of this cancer. The particular isoenzymes of ADH present in the serum may indicate the cancer localization.","['retinal', 'NADH', 'H+']","['retinol', 'NAD+']","['CC1=C(C(CCC1)(C)C)/C=C/C(=C/C=C/C(=C/C=O)/C)/C', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']","['CC1=C(C(CCC1)(C)C)/C=C/C(=C/C=C/C(=C/CO)/C)/C', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

Screening a Swedish population revealed that Val308 was the most frequent allele (73%), and site-directed mutagenesis was used to obtain both allelozymes, which were expressed in Escherichia coli for characterisation. Thermostability was assayed by activity measurements and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results showed that the 308Val substitution decreases protein stability, as compared to the Ile308 variant, an effect also demonstrated during prolonged storage. Ethanol, octanol, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid and all-trans retinol were used as model substrates and, generally, slightly higher Km values were observed with Val at position 308. Finally, homology modelling, from mouse ADH2, further supported the decreased stability of the Val308 variant and located position 308 in the subunit interface of the molecule and in the vicinity of the active-site pocket entrance.

A further activity of TADH, the production of carboxylic acids by dismutation of aldehydes, was investigated.

This homodimer exhibits subtle differences in its absorption spectrum and amino acid composition relative to those of other human isozymes but differs markedly from their specificity toward alcohols and aldehydes. chi-ADH oxidizes ethanol very poorly. The reaction is bimolecular, and an apparent Km cannot be discerned up to 2.3 M ethanol. The enzyme is inactive toward methanol, ethylene glycol, digitoxigenin, digoxigenin, and gitoxigenin , but alcohols with carbon chain lengths greater than four are oxidized rapidly with Km values decreasing with increasing carbon chain length.

XR belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, and shows high sequence identity with mouse lung carbonyl reductase (MLCR), an enzyme that reduces 3-ketosteroids but not sugars. In this study, we have confirmed the roles of Ser136, Tyr149 and Lys153 of XR as the catalytic triad by drastic loss of activity resulting from the mutagenesis of S136A, Y149F and K153M in rat XR. We have also constructed several mutant XRs, in which putative substrate binding residues from rat XR were substituted with those found in the corresponding positions of MLCR, in order to identify amino acids responsible for the different substrate recognition of the enzymes. While single mutants at positions 137, 143, 146, 190 and 191 caused little or moderate change in substrate specificity, a double mutant (N190V and W191S) and triple mutant (Q137M, L143F and H146L) resulted in almost loss of activity for only the sugars. In addition, the triple mutant exhibited 3-ketosteroid reductase activity, which was further enhanced by quintuple mutagenesis of the above five residues. These results suggest the importance of the size and hydrophobicity of the five residues for substrate recognition by XR and MLCR. Furthermore, the mutant enzymes containing a Q137M mutation were stable against cooling, which provides a structural mechanism of the cold inactivation that is a characteristic of the rodent XR.","['1,4-dibromo-2,3-butanedione', 'NADPH']","['?', 'NADP+']","['C(C(=O)C(=O)CBr)Br', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O']",['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']

Here we report the identification of a novel L-xylulose reductase LXR3 in the fungus Trichoderma reesei by a bioinformatic approach in combination with a functional analysis. LXR3, a 31 kDa protein, catalyzes the reduction of L-xylulose to xylitol via NADPH and is also able to convert D-xylulose, D-ribulose, L-sorbose, and D-fructose to their corresponding polyols. Transcription of lxr3 is specifically induced by L-arabinose and L-arabitol. Deletion of lxr3 affects growth on L-arabinose and L-arabitol and reduces total NADPH-dependent LXR activity in cell free extracts. A phylogenetic analysis of known L-xylulose reductases shows that LXR3 is phylogenetically different from the Aspergillus niger L-xylulose reductase LxrA and, moreover, that all identified true L-xylulose reductases belong to different clades within the superfamily of SDRs.

The enzyme is part of the yeast pathway for l-arabinose catabolism. A fungal pathway for l-arabinose utilization has been described previously for molds. In this pathway l-arabinose is sequentially converted to l-arabinitol, l-xylulose, xylitol, and d-xylulose and enters the pentose phosphate pathway as d-xylulose 5-phosphate. In molds the reductions are NADPH-linked, and the oxidations are NAD(+)-linked. Here we show that in A. monospora the pathway is similar, i.e. it has the same two reduction and two oxidation reactions, but the reduction by l-xylulose reductase is not performed by a strictly NADPH-dependent enzyme as in molds but by a strictly NADH-dependent enzyme. The ALX1 gene encoding the NADH-dependent l-xylulose reductase is strongly expressed during growth on l-arabinose as shown by Northern analysis. The gene was functionally overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the purified His-tagged protein characterized. The reversible enzyme converts l-xylulose to xylitol. It also converts d-ribulose to d-arabinitol but has no activity with l-arabinitol or adonitol, i.e. it is specific for sugar alcohols where, in a Fischer projection, the hydroxyl group of the C-2 is in the l-configuration and the hydroxyl group of C-3 is in the d-configuration. It also has no activity with C-6 sugars or sugar alcohols. The K(m) values for l-xylulose and d-ribulose are 9.6 and 4.7 mm, respectively.

The enzyme is part of the yeast pathway for l-arabinose catabolism. A fungal pathway for l-arabinose utilization has been described previously for molds. In this pathway l-arabinose is sequentially converted to l-arabinitol, l-xylulose, xylitol, and d-xylulose and enters the pentose phosphate pathway as d-xylulose 5-phosphate. In molds the reductions are NADPH-linked, and the oxidations are NAD(+)-linked. Here we show that in A. monospora the pathway is similar, i.e. it has the same two reduction and two oxidation reactions, but the reduction by l-xylulose reductase is not performed by a strictly NADPH-dependent enzyme as in molds but by a strictly NADH-dependent enzyme. The ALX1 gene encoding the NADH-dependent l-xylulose reductase is strongly expressed during growth on l-arabinose as shown by Northern analysis. The gene was functionally overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the purified His-tagged protein characterized. The reversible enzyme converts l-xylulose to xylitol. It also converts d-ribulose to d-arabinitol but has no activity with l-arabinitol or adonitol, i.e. it is specific for sugar alcohols where, in a Fischer projection, the hydroxyl group of the C-2 is in the l-configuration and the hydroxyl group of C-3 is in the d-configuration. It also has no activity with C-6 sugars or sugar alcohols. The K(m) values for l-xylulose and d-ribulose are 9.6 and 4.7 mm, respectively.

Here we report the identification of a novel L-xylulose reductase LXR3 in the fungus Trichoderma reesei by a bioinformatic approach in combination with a functional analysis. LXR3, a 31 kDa protein, catalyzes the reduction of L-xylulose to xylitol via NADPH and is also able to convert D-xylulose, D-ribulose, L-sorbose, and D-fructose to their corresponding polyols. Transcription of lxr3 is specifically induced by L-arabinose and L-arabitol. Deletion of lxr3 affects growth on L-arabinose and L-arabitol and reduces total NADPH-dependent LXR activity in cell free extracts. A phylogenetic analysis of known L-xylulose reductases shows that LXR3 is phylogenetically different from the Aspergillus niger L-xylulose reductase LxrA and, moreover, that all identified true L-xylulose reductases belong to different clades within the superfamily of SDRs. This indicates that the enzymes responsible for the reduction of L-xylulose in L-arabinose and glucuronic acid catabolic pathways have evolved independently and that even the fungal LXRs of the L-arabinose catabolic pathway have evolved in different clades of the superfamily of SDRs.","['D-xylulose', 'NADPH', 'H+']","['xylitol', 'NADP+']","['C([C@H]([C@@H](C(=O)CO)O)O)O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']","['C([C@H](C([C@H](CO)O)O)O)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

Among the SDR enzymes, XR shows the highest sequence identity (67%) with mouse lung carbonyl reductase (MLCR), but the two enzymes show different substrate specificities. The crystal structure of human XR in complex with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) was determined at 1.96 A resolution by using the molecular replacement method and the structure of MLCR as the search model. Features unique to human XR include electrostatic interactions between the N-terminal residues of subunits related by the P-axis, termed according to SDR convention, and an interaction between the hydroxy group of Ser185 and the pyrophosphate of NADPH. Furthermore, identification of the residues lining the active site of XR (Cys138, Val143, His146, Trp191, and Met200) together with a model structure of XR in complex with L-xylulose, revealed structural differences with other members of the SDR family, which may account for the distinct substrate specificity of XR. The residues comprising a recently proposed catalytic tetrad in the SDR enzymes are conserved in human XR (Asn107, Ser136, Tyr149, and Lys153). To examine the role of Asn107 in the catalytic mechanism of human XR, mutant forms (N107D and N107L) were prepared. The two mutations increased K(m) for the substrate (>26-fold) and K(d) for NADPH (95-fold), but only the N107L mutation significantly decreased k(cat) value. These results suggest that Asn107 plays a critical role in coenzyme binding rather than in the catalytic mechanism.","['diacetyl', 'NAD(P)H']","['acetoin', 'NAD(P)+']",['CC(=O)C(=O)C'],['CC(C(=O)C)O']

Xylitol-positive mutants constitutively synthesized both a novel NAD-dependent xylitol-4-dehydrogenase, which oxidized xylitol to L-xylulose, and an L-xylulokinase. The xylitol dehydrogenase had a Km for xylitol of 48 mM and showed best activity with xylitol and D-threitol as substrates. However, D-threitol was not a growth substrate for E. uredovora, and its presence did not induce either dehydrogenase or kinase activity.

The ALX1 gene encoding the NADH-dependent l-xylulose reductase is strongly expressed during growth on l-arabinose as shown by Northern analysis. The gene was functionally overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the purified His-tagged protein characterized. The reversible enzyme converts l-xylulose to xylitol. It also converts d-ribulose to d-arabinitol but has no activity with l-arabinitol or adonitol, i.e. it is specific for sugar alcohols where, in a Fischer projection, the hydroxyl group of the C-2 is in the l-configuration and the hydroxyl group of C-3 is in the d-configuration. It also has no activity with C-6 sugars or sugar alcohols. The K(m) values for l-xylulose and d-ribulose are 9.6 and 4.7 mm, respectively.

Here we show that in A. monospora the pathway is similar, i.e. it has the same two reduction and two oxidation reactions, but the reduction by l-xylulose reductase is not performed by a strictly NADPH-dependent enzyme as in molds but by a strictly NADH-dependent enzyme. The ALX1 gene encoding the NADH-dependent l-xylulose reductase is strongly expressed during growth on l-arabinose as shown by Northern analysis. The gene was functionally overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the purified His-tagged protein characterized. The reversible enzyme converts l-xylulose to xylitol. It also converts d-ribulose to d-arabinitol but has no activity with l-arabinitol or adonitol, i.e. it is specific for sugar alcohols where, in a Fischer projection, the hydroxyl group of the C-2 is in the l-configuration and the hydroxyl group of C-3 is in the d-configuration. It also has no activity with C-6 sugars or sugar alcohols. The K(m) values for l-xylulose and d-ribulose are 9.6 and 4.7 mm, respectively. To our knowledge this is the first report of an NADH-linked l-xylulose reductase.","['L-xylulose', 'NADH']","['L-xylitol', 'NAD+']","['C([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)CO)O)O)O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O']","['C([C@H](C([C@H](CO)O)O)O)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)([O-])OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

The cDNAs of the five species encoded polypeptides of 244 amino acids, which shared more than 85% identity with each other and showed high identity with a human sperm 34-kDa protein, P34H, as well as a murine lung-specific carbonyl reductase of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. In particular, the human protein is identical to P34H, except for one amino acid substitution. The purified recombinant proteins of the five species were about 100-kDa homotetramers with NADPH-linked reductase activity for alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, catalyzed the oxidoreduction between xylitol and l-xylulose, and were inhibited competitively by n-butyric acid. Therefore, the proteins are designated as dicarbonyl/l-xylulose reductases (DCXRs). The substrate specificity and kinetic constants of DCXRs for dicarbonyl compounds and sugars are similar to those of mammalian diacetyl reductase and l-xylulose reductase, respectively, and the identity of the DCXRs with these two enzymes was demonstrated by their co-purification from hamster and guinea pig livers and by protein sequencing of the hepatic enzymes. Both DCXR and its mRNA are highly expressed in kidney and liver of human and rodent tissues, and the protein was localized primarily to the inner membranes of the proximal renal tubules in murine kidneys. The results imply that P34H and diacetyl reductase (EC ) are identical to l-xylulose reductase (EC ), which is involved in the uronate cycle of glucose metabolism, and the unique localization of the enzyme in kidney suggests that it has a role other than in general carbohydrate metabolism.","['L-xylulose', 'NADPH', 'H+']","['L-xylitol', 'NADP+']","['C([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)CO)O)O)O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']","['C([C@H](C([C@H](CO)O)O)O)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

In the present work, the activity of the enzymes xylose reductase (XR); xylitol dehydrogenase (XD); and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) during cultivation of Candida guilliermondii on rice straw hemicellulosic hydrolysate was measured and correlated with xylitol production under different pH values (around 4.5 and 7.5) and initial xylose concentration (around 30 and 70 g l(-1)). Independent of the pH value and xylose concentration evaluated, the title of XD remained constant. On the other hand, the volumetric activity of G6PD increased whereas the level of XR decreased when the initial xylose concentration was increased from 30 to 70 g l(-1). The highest values of xylitol productivity (Q (P) approximately 0.40 g l(-1)) and yield factor (Y (P/S) approximately 0.60 g g(-1)) were reached at highest G6PD/XR ratio and lowest XR/XD ratio. These results suggest that NADPH concentrations influence the formation of xylitol more than the activity ratios of the enzymes XR and XD.

In this study, we constructed a set of recombinant S. cerevisiae strains with xylose-fermenting ability, including protein-engineered NADP(+)-dependent XDH-expressing strains. The most positive effect on xylose-to-ethanol fermentation was found by using a strain named MA-N5, constructed by chromosomal integration of the gene for NADP(+)-dependent XDH along with XR and endogenous xylulokinase genes. The MA-N5 strain had an increase in ethanol production and decrease in xylitol excretion compared with the reference strain expressing wild-type XDH when fermenting not only xylose but also mixed sugars containing glucose and xylose. Furthermore, the MA-N5 strain produced ethanol with a high yield of 0.49 g of ethanol/g of total consumed sugars in the nonsulfuric acid hydrolysate of wood chips.

A deviation from the optimal level of these cofactors often results in major changes in the substrate uptake and biomass formation. However, the metabolism of xylose by recombinant S. cerevisiae carrying xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase from the fungal pathway requires both NADH and NADPH and creates cofactor imbalance during growth on xylose. As one possible solution to overcoming this imbalance, the effect of overexpressing the native NADH kinase (encoded by the POS5 gene) in xylose-consuming recombinant S. cerevisiae directed either into the cytosol or to the mitochondria was evaluated. The physiology of the NADH kinase containing strains was also evaluated during growth on glucose. Overexpressing NADH kinase in the cytosol redirected carbon flow from CO(2) to ethanol during aerobic growth on glucose and to ethanol and acetate during anaerobic growth on glucose. However, cytosolic NADH kinase has an opposite effect during anaerobic metabolism of xylose consumption by channeling carbon flow from ethanol to xylitol. In contrast, overexpressing NADH kinase in the mitochondria did not affect the physiology to a large extent. Overall, although NADH kinase did not increase the rate of xylose consumption, we believe that it can provide an important source of NADPH in yeast, which can be useful for metabolic engineering strategies where the redox fluxes are manipulated.","['L-xylulose', 'NADPH', 'H+']","['L-xylitol', 'NADP+']","['C([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)CO)O)O)O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']","['C([C@H](C([C@H](CO)O)O)O)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

The enzyme is part of the yeast pathway for l-arabinose catabolism. A fungal pathway for l-arabinose utilization has been described previously for molds. In this pathway l-arabinose is sequentially converted to l-arabinitol, l-xylulose, xylitol, and d-xylulose and enters the pentose phosphate pathway as d-xylulose 5-phosphate. In molds the reductions are NADPH-linked, and the oxidations are NAD(+)-linked. Here we show that in A. monospora the pathway is similar, i.e. it has the same two reduction and two oxidation reactions, but the reduction by l-xylulose reductase is not performed by a strictly NADPH-dependent enzyme as in molds but by a strictly NADH-dependent enzyme. The ALX1 gene encoding the NADH-dependent l-xylulose reductase is strongly expressed during growth on l-arabinose as shown by Northern analysis. The gene was functionally overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the purified His-tagged protein characterized. The reversible enzyme converts l-xylulose to xylitol. It also converts d-ribulose to d-arabinitol but has no activity with l-arabinitol or adonitol, i.e. it is specific for sugar alcohols where, in a Fischer projection, the hydroxyl group of the C-2 is in the l-configuration and the hydroxyl group of C-3 is in the d-configuration. It also has no activity with C-6 sugars or sugar alcohols. The K(m) values for l-xylulose and d-ribulose are 9.6 and 4.7 mm, respectively.

XR belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, and shows high sequence identity with mouse lung carbonyl reductase (MLCR), an enzyme that reduces 3-ketosteroids but not sugars. In this study, we have confirmed the roles of Ser136, Tyr149 and Lys153 of XR as the catalytic triad by drastic loss of activity resulting from the mutagenesis of S136A, Y149F and K153M in rat XR. We have also constructed several mutant XRs, in which putative substrate binding residues from rat XR were substituted with those found in the corresponding positions of MLCR, in order to identify amino acids responsible for the different substrate recognition of the enzymes. While single mutants at positions 137, 143, 146, 190 and 191 caused little or moderate change in substrate specificity, a double mutant (N190V and W191S) and triple mutant (Q137M, L143F and H146L) resulted in almost loss of activity for only the sugars. In addition, the triple mutant exhibited 3-ketosteroid reductase activity, which was further enhanced by quintuple mutagenesis of the above five residues. These results suggest the importance of the size and hydrophobicity of the five residues for substrate recognition by XR and MLCR.

Here we report the identification of a novel L-xylulose reductase LXR3 in the fungus Trichoderma reesei by a bioinformatic approach in combination with a functional analysis. LXR3, a 31 kDa protein, catalyzes the reduction of L-xylulose to xylitol via NADPH and is also able to convert D-xylulose, D-ribulose, L-sorbose, and D-fructose to their corresponding polyols. Transcription of lxr3 is specifically induced by L-arabinose and L-arabitol. Deletion of lxr3 affects growth on L-arabinose and L-arabitol and reduces total NADPH-dependent LXR activity in cell free extracts. A phylogenetic analysis of known L-xylulose reductases shows that LXR3 is phylogenetically different from the Aspergillus niger L-xylulose reductase LxrA and, moreover, that all identified true L-xylulose reductases belong to different clades within the superfamily of SDRs. This indicates that the enzymes responsible for the reduction of L-xylulose in L-arabinose and glucuronic acid catabolic pathways have evolved independently and that even the fungal LXRs of the L-arabinose catabolic pathway have evolved in different clades of the superfamily of SDRs.","['xylitol', 'NADP+']","['L-xylulose', 'NADPH', 'H+']","['C([C@H](C([C@H](CO)O)O)O)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['C([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)CO)O)O)O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

Here we report the identification of a novel L-xylulose reductase LXR3 in the fungus Trichoderma reesei by a bioinformatic approach in combination with a functional analysis. LXR3, a 31 kDa protein, catalyzes the reduction of L-xylulose to xylitol via NADPH and is also able to convert D-xylulose, D-ribulose, L-sorbose, and D-fructose to their corresponding polyols. Transcription of lxr3 is specifically induced by L-arabinose and L-arabitol. Deletion of lxr3 affects growth on L-arabinose and L-arabitol and reduces total NADPH-dependent LXR activity in cell free extracts. A phylogenetic analysis of known L-xylulose reductases shows that LXR3 is phylogenetically different from the Aspergillus niger L-xylulose reductase LxrA and, moreover, that all identified true L-xylulose reductases belong to different clades within the superfamily of SDRs. This indicates that the enzymes responsible for the reduction of L-xylulose in L-arabinose and glucuronic acid catabolic pathways have evolved independently and that even the fungal LXRs of the L-arabinose catabolic pathway have evolved in different clades of the superfamily of SDRs.","['xylitol', 'NADP+']","['L-xylulose', 'NADPH', 'H+']","['C([C@H](C([C@H](CO)O)O)O)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']","['C([C@@H]([C@H](C(=O)CO)O)O)O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']"

FabG catalyzes reduction of a 3-oxo-acyl-ACP intermediate during the elongation cycle of fatty acid biosynthesis. Here, we report gene deletion experiments that support the essentiality of this gene in P. aeruginosa and the identification of a number of small molecule FabG inhibitors with IC50 values in the nanomolar to low micromolar range and good physicochemical properties. Structural characterization of 16 FabG-inhibitor complexes by X-ray crystallography revealed that the compounds bind at a novel allosteric site located at the FabG subunit-subunit interface. Inhibitor binding relies primarily on hydrophobic interactions, but specific hydrogen bonds are also observed. Importantly, the binding cavity is formed upon complex formation and therefore would not be recognized by virtual screening approaches. The structure analysis further reveals that the inhibitors act by inducing conformational changes that propagate to the active site, resulting in a displacement of the catalytic triad and the inability to bind NADPH.

However, two of these extracts synthesized significant levels of medium chain fatty acids (rather than C16 and C18 acid) from [14C]malonyl-CoA; these extracts had elevated levels of acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase. To explore the role of the acetyl transacylase more carefully, this enzyme was purified some 180-fold from spinach leaf extracts. Varying concentrations of the transacylase were then added either to spinach leaf extracts or to a completely reconstituted FAS system consisting of highly purified enzymes. The results suggested that: (a) acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase was the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the plant FAS system; (b) increasing concentration of this enzyme markedly increased the levels of the medium chain fatty acids, whereas increase of the other enzymes of the FAS system led to increased levels of stearic acid synthesis; and (c) beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase I was not involved in the rate-limiting step.

The equilibrium unfolding of FabG by urea is a multistep process as compared with a two-state process by GdmCl. FabG is fully unfolded at 6.0M urea and 4.0M GdmCl. Approximately 90% of the enzyme activity could be recovered on dialyzing the denaturants, showing that denaturation by both urea and GdmCl is reversible. We found two states in the reversible unfolding process of FabG in presence of NADPH; one is an activity-enhanced state and the other, an inactive state in case of equilibrium unfolding with urea. On the contrary, in presence of NADPH, there is no stabilization of FabG in case of equilibrium unfolding with GdmCl. We hypothesize that the hydrogen-bonding network may be reorganized by the denaturant in the activity-enhanced state formed in presence of 1.0M urea, by interrupting the association between dimer-dimer interface and help in accommodating the larger substrate in the substrate binding tunnel thus, increasing the activity. Furthermore, binding of the active site organizer, NADPH leads to compaction of the FabG in presence of urea, as evident by acrylamide quenching. We have shown here for the first time, the detailed inactivation kinetics of FabG, which have not been evaluated in the past from any of the FabG family of enzymes from any of the other sources.

It is suggested that modulation of the activity of acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase may have important implications in the type of fatty acid synthesized, as well as the amount of fatty acids formed.","['3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier protein]', 'NADPH']","['(3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier protein]', 'NADP+']",['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O'],"['C(CO)C(=O)S', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

In the present work, the mabA-encoded MabA has been cloned, expressed, and purified to homogeneity. Initial velocity studies, product inhibition, and primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects suggested a steady-state random bi-bi kinetic mechanism for the MabA-catalyzed reaction. The magnitudes of the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect indicated that the C(4)-proS hydrogen is transferred from the pyridine nucleotide and that this transfer contributes modestly to the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The pH-rate profiles demonstrated groups with pK values of 6.9 and 8.0, important for binding of NADPH, and with pK values of 8.8 and 9.6, important for binding of AcAcCoA and for catalysis, respectively. Temperature studies were employed to determine the activation energy of the reaction. Solvent kinetic isotope effects and proton inventory analysis established that a single proton is transferred in a partially rate-limiting step and that the mechanism of carbonyl reduction is probably concerted. The observation of an inverse (D)2(O)V/K and an increase in (D)2(O)V when [4S-(2)H]NADPH was the varied substrate obscured the distinction between stepwise and concerted mechanisms; however, the latter was further supported by the pH dependence of the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect.

The activation of the enzyme is usually linked to the formation of a catalytic triad and cofactor binding, and crystal structures of FabG from different organisms have been captured in either the active or inactive conformation. However, the structural elements which enable activation of FabG require further exploration. Here we report the findings of structural, enzymatic, and binding studies of the FabG protein found in the causative agent of cholera, Vibrio cholerae (vcFabG). vcFabG exists predominantly as a dimer in solution and is able to self-associate to form tetramers, which is the state seen in the crystal structure. The formation of the tetramer may be promoted by the presence of the cofactor NADP(H). The transition between the dimeric and tetrameric states of vcFabG is related to changes in the conformations of the α4/α5 helices on the dimer-dimer interface. Two glycine residues adjacent to the dimer interface (G92 and G141) are identified to be the hinge for the conformational changes, while the catalytic tyrosine (Y155) and a glutamine residue that forms hydrogen bonds to both loop β4-α4 and loop β5-α5 (Q152) stabilize the active conformation.

Especially important are the short-chain-length-medium-chain-length (SCL-MCL) PHA copolymers, which have properties ranging from thermoplastic to elastomeric, depending on the ratio of SCL to MCL monomers incorporated into the copolymer. Because of the potential wide range of applications for SCL-MCL PHA copolymers, it is important to develop and characterize metabolic pathways for SCL-MCL PHA production. In previous studies, coexpression of PHA synthase genes and the 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase gene (fabG) in recombinant Escherichia coli has been shown to enhance PHA production from related carbon sources such as fatty acids. In this study, a new fabG gene from Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 was cloned and its gene product characterized. Results indicate that the Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 and E. coli FabG proteins have different substrate specificities in vitro. The current study also presents the first evidence that coexpression of fabG genes from either E. coli or Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 with fabH(F87T) and PHA synthase genes can enhance the production of SCL-MCL PHA copolymers from nonrelated carbon sources.

Human FAS is also a component of biological membranes and it is implicated in the overexpression of several types of cancers. In this work, we describe the catalytic mechanism of β-ketoreductase (KR), which is a catalytic domain of the hFAS enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of β-ketoacyl to β-hydroxyacyl with the concomitant oxidation of the NADPH cofactor. The catalysis by KR is an intermediate step in the cycle of reactions that elongate the substrate's carbon chain until the final product is obtained. We study and propose the catalytic mechanism of the KR domain determined using the hybrid QM/MM methodology, at the ONIOM(B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p):AMBER) level of theory. The results indicate that the reaction mechanism occurs in two stages: (i) nucleophilic attack by a NADPH hydride to the β-carbon of the substrate, together with an asynchronous deprotonation of the Tyr2034 by the oxygen of the β-alkoxide to hold the final alcohol product; and (ii) an asynchronous deprotonation of the hydroxyl in the NADP","['a 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier protein]', 'NADPH', 'H+']","['a (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier protein]', 'NADP+']","['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']",['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']

Recent studies suggest there is a fatty acid synthetase II pathway that consists of a series of separate enzymes in yeast mitochondrion. Here, we present the crystal structure of the yeast mitochondria OAR1 (ymtOAR1) alone in apo-form at 2.60 Å and complexed with NADPH at 2.10 Å resolution. Unlike the reported tetrameric OARs, ymtOAR1 forms a homodimer due to the different fold. The enzyme generates conformational changes upon NADPH binding to the active site. Moreover, two different cofactor-binding patterns are observed from two forms of complex crystals, and structural analysis implies the adenine end of cofactor may recognize enzyme prior to nicotinaminde end. Additionally, biochemical studies suggest Arg14 is important for cofactor recognition of ymtOAR1.","['a 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier protein]', 'NADPH', 'H+']","['a (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier protein]', 'NADP+']","['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']",['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']

Because of the potential wide range of applications for SCL-MCL PHA copolymers, it is important to develop and characterize metabolic pathways for SCL-MCL PHA production. In previous studies, coexpression of PHA synthase genes and the 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase gene (fabG) in recombinant Escherichia coli has been shown to enhance PHA production from related carbon sources such as fatty acids. In this study, a new fabG gene from Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 was cloned and its gene product characterized. Results indicate that the Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 and E. coli FabG proteins have different substrate specificities in vitro. The current study also presents the first evidence that coexpression of fabG genes from either E. coli or Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 with fabH(F87T) and PHA synthase genes can enhance the production of SCL-MCL PHA copolymers from nonrelated carbon sources. Differences in the substrate specificities of the FabG proteins were reflected in the monomer composition of the polymers produced by recombinant E. coli.

The results of Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that chlorogenic acid inhibited competitively the binding of NADPH to FAS I, while left those of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA unaffected. Further kinetic studies showed that chlorogenic acid blocked the activity of FAS I mainly by inhibiting the ss-ketoacyl reductase domain, which catalyzed the same reaction as that done by FabG in the fatty acid synthesis. The ss-ketoacyl reduction reactions accomplished by both FAS I and FabG required nucleotide cofactor, NADPH. Furthermore, the Lineweaver-Burk and Yonetani-Theorell analyses implicated that chlorogenic acid filled competitively in the binding-pocket of NADPH in the ss-ketoacyl reductase domain of FAS I. The similar results were also obtained from the inhibition of FabG by chlorogenic acid. As observed in these results, the inhibitions of FAS I and FabG by chlorogenic acid were highly related to the interference of the inhibitor with NADPH, which was possibly due to the similarity between chlorogenic acid and some portion of NADPH, maybe the section consisting of the two ribose groups.","['acetoacetyl-CoA', 'NADPH']","['3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA', 'NADP+']","['CC(=O)CC(=O)SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)[C@@H](C(C)(C)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O1)N2C=NC3=C(N=CN=C32)N)O)OP(=O)(O)O)O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O']","['CC(CC(=O)SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)[C@@H](C(C)(C)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O1)N2C=NC3=C(N=CN=C32)N)O)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

Significant and identical primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects were observed for V (2.6 +/- 0.4), V/K(NADPH) (2.6 +/- 0.1), and V/K(AcAc)(-)(CoA) (2.6 +/- 0.1) at pH 7.6, but all three values attenuated to values of near unity (1.1 +/- 0.03 or 0.91 +/- 0.02) at pH 10. Similarly, the large alpha-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 1.15 +/- 0.02 observed for [4R-(2)H]NADPH on V/K(AcAc)(-)(CoA) at pH 7.6 was reduced to a value of unity (1.00 +/- 0.04) at high pH. The complete analysis of the pH profiles and the solvent, primary, secondary, and multiple deuterium isotope effects were most consistent with a chemical mechanism of KACPR that is stepwise, wherein the hydride-transfer step is followed by protonation of the enolate intermediate. Estimations of the intrinsic primary and secondary deuterium isotope effects ((D)k = 2.7, (alpha)(-D)k = 1.16) and the correspondingly negligible commitment factors suggest a nearly full expression of the intrinsic isotope effects on (D)V/K and (alpha)(-D)V/K, and are consistent with a late transition state for the hydride transfer step. Conversely, the estimated intrinsic solvent effect ((D)2(O)k) of 5.3 was poorly expressed in the experimentally derived parameters (D)2(O)V/K and (D)2(O)V (both = 1.2 +/- 0.1), in agreement with the estimation that the catalytic commitment factor for proton transfer to the enolate intermediate is large. Such detailed knowledge of the chemical mechanism of KAPCR may now help guide the rational design of, or inform screening assay-design strategies for, potent inhibitors of this and related enzymes of the short chain dehydrogenase enzyme class.","['acetoacetyl-CoA', 'NADPH']","['3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA', 'NADP+']","['CC(=O)CC(=O)SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)[C@@H](C(C)(C)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O1)N2C=NC3=C(N=CN=C32)N)O)OP(=O)(O)O)O', 'C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O']","['CC(CC(=O)SCCNC(=O)CCNC(=O)[C@@H](C(C)(C)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O1)N2C=NC3=C(N=CN=C32)N)O)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O', 'C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']"

In the present work, the mabA-encoded MabA has been cloned, expressed, and purified to homogeneity. Initial velocity studies, product inhibition, and primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects suggested a steady-state random bi-bi kinetic mechanism for the MabA-catalyzed reaction. The magnitudes of the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect indicated that the C(4)-proS hydrogen is transferred from the pyridine nucleotide and that this transfer contributes modestly to the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The pH-rate profiles demonstrated groups with pK values of 6.9 and 8.0, important for binding of NADPH, and with pK values of 8.8 and 9.6, important for binding of AcAcCoA and for catalysis, respectively. Temperature studies were employed to determine the activation energy of the reaction. Solvent kinetic isotope effects and proton inventory analysis established that a single proton is transferred in a partially rate-limiting step and that the mechanism of carbonyl reduction is probably concerted. The observation of an inverse (D)2(O)V/K and an increase in (D)2(O)V when [4S-(2)H]NADPH was the varied substrate obscured the distinction between stepwise and concerted mechanisms; however, the latter was further supported by the pH dependence of the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect.

The equilibrium unfolding of FabG by urea is a multistep process as compared with a two-state process by GdmCl. FabG is fully unfolded at 6.0M urea and 4.0M GdmCl. Approximately 90% of the enzyme activity could be recovered on dialyzing the denaturants, showing that denaturation by both urea and GdmCl is reversible. We found two states in the reversible unfolding process of FabG in presence of NADPH; one is an activity-enhanced state and the other, an inactive state in case of equilibrium unfolding with urea. On the contrary, in presence of NADPH, there is no stabilization of FabG in case of equilibrium unfolding with GdmCl. We hypothesize that the hydrogen-bonding network may be reorganized by the denaturant in the activity-enhanced state formed in presence of 1.0M urea, by interrupting the association between dimer-dimer interface and help in accommodating the larger substrate in the substrate binding tunnel thus, increasing the activity. Furthermore, binding of the active site organizer, NADPH leads to compaction of the FabG in presence of urea, as evident by acrylamide quenching.

Because of the potential wide range of applications for SCL-MCL PHA copolymers, it is important to develop and characterize metabolic pathways for SCL-MCL PHA production. In previous studies, coexpression of PHA synthase genes and the 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase gene (fabG) in recombinant Escherichia coli has been shown to enhance PHA production from related carbon sources such as fatty acids. In this study, a new fabG gene from Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 was cloned and its gene product characterized. Results indicate that the Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 and E. coli FabG proteins have different substrate specificities in vitro. The current study also presents the first evidence that coexpression of fabG genes from either E. coli or Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 with fabH(F87T) and PHA synthase genes can enhance the production of SCL-MCL PHA copolymers from nonrelated carbon sources. Differences in the substrate specificities of the FabG proteins were reflected in the monomer composition of the polymers produced by recombinant E. coli.

Structural characterization of 16 FabG-inhibitor complexes by X-ray crystallography revealed that the compounds bind at a novel allosteric site located at the FabG subunit-subunit interface. Inhibitor binding relies primarily on hydrophobic interactions, but specific hydrogen bonds are also observed.

The activation of the enzyme is usually linked to the formation of a catalytic triad and cofactor binding, and crystal structures of FabG from different organisms have been captured in either the active or inactive conformation. However, the structural elements which enable activation of FabG require further exploration. Here we report the findings of structural, enzymatic, and binding studies of the FabG protein found in the causative agent of cholera, Vibrio cholerae (vcFabG). vcFabG exists predominantly as a dimer in solution and is able to self-associate to form tetramers, which is the state seen in the crystal structure. The formation of the tetramer may be promoted by the presence of the cofactor NADP(H). The transition between the dimeric and tetrameric states of vcFabG is related to changes in the conformations of the α4/α5 helices on the dimer-dimer interface. Two glycine residues adjacent to the dimer interface (G92 and G141) are identified to be the hinge for the conformational changes, while the catalytic tyrosine (Y155) and a glutamine residue that forms hydrogen bonds to both loop β4-α4 and loop β5-α5 (Q152) stabilize the active conformation.

Here, we present the crystal structure of the yeast mitochondria OAR1 (ymtOAR1) alone in apo-form at 2.60 Å and complexed with NADPH at 2.10 Å resolution. Unlike the reported tetrameric OARs, ymtOAR1 forms a homodimer due to the different fold. The enzyme generates conformational changes upon NADPH binding to the active site. Moreover, two different cofactor-binding patterns are observed from two forms of complex crystals, and structural analysis implies the adenine end of cofactor may recognize enzyme prior to nicotinaminde end.

Here we provide a structural explanation for the stability of the heterotetramer from the crystal structure with NAD(+) and NADP(+) bound to the HSD17B8 and CBR4 subunits, respectively, and show that the catalytic activity of the NADPH- and ACP-dependent CBR4 subunit is crucial for a functional HsKAR. Therefore, mtFAS is NADPH- and ACP dependent, employing the 3R-hydroxyacyl-ACP intermediate. HSD17B8 assists in the formation of the competent HsKAR assembly. The intrinsic NAD(+)- and CoA-dependent activity of the HSD17B8 subunit on the 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates may indicate a role for this subunit in routing 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA esters, potentially arising from the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids, into the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway.

In this article, we report intensive studies on the direct interactions of Plasmodium FabG and Plasmodium ACP in solution, in the presence and absence of its cofactor, NADPH, by monitoring the change in intrinsic fluorescence of P.falciparum FabG (PfFabG) and by surface plasmon resonance. To address the issue of the importance of the residues involved in strong, specific and stoichiometric binding of PfFabG to P.falciparum ACP (PfACP), we mutated Arg187, Arg190 and Arg230 of PfFabG. The activities of the mutants were assessed using both an ACP-dependent and an ACP-independent assay. The affinities of all the PfFabG mutants for acetoacetyl-ACP (the physiological substrate) were reduced to different extents as compared to wild-type PfFabG, but were equally active in biochemical assays with the substrate analog acetoacetyl-CoA. Kinetic analysis and studies of direct binding between PfFabG and PfACP confirmed the identification of Arg187 and Arg230 as critical residues for the PfFabG-PfACP interactions. Our studies thus reveal the significance of the positively charged/hydrophobic patch located adjacent to the active site cavities of PfFabG for interactions with PfACP.","['acetoacetyl-[acyl-carrier protein]', 'NADPH']","['D-beta-hydroxybutyryl-[acyl-carrier protein]', 'NADP+']",['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O'],['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']

This reaction is catalysed by specific AHL synthases, which exhibit acyl chain specificity. Culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa contain multiple 3-oxo-AHLs that differ in their acyl chain lengths but their physiological role, if any, remains unknown. An in vitro fatty acid-3-oxo-AHL synthesis system was established utilizing purified P. aeruginosa Fab proteins, ACP and the LasI 3-oxo-AHL synthase. In the presence of excess protein, substrates and cofactors, this system produced almost exclusively 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL. When the beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG) catalysed step was made rate-limiting by switching from the preferred NADPH cofactor to NADH, increased levels of short chain 3-oxo-AHLs were produced, presumably because shorter-chain ketoacyl-ACPs accumulated and thus became LasI substrates. Consistent with these in vitro observations, a fabG(Ts) mutant produced increased amounts of 3-oxo-AHLs in vivo.

Crystallographic analysis reveals that the overall structures of the RhlG.NADP+ and FabG.NADP+ complexes are indeed similar, but there are key differences related to function.

Also, the acyl chain-binding pocket of RhlG is narrow and rigid compared with the larger, flexible substrate-binding subdomain in FabG. Finally, RhlG lacks a positively charged/hydrophobic surface feature adjacent to the active site that is found on enzymes like FabG that recognize the ACP of fatty acid synthesis. RhlG catalyzed the NADPH-dependent reduction of beta-ketodecanoyl-ACP to beta-d-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP. However, the enzyme was 2000-fold less active than FabG in carrying out the same reaction.

The enzyme was solubilized from the resulting residue by 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 M KCl, 0.3 mM NADPH, and 2 mM dithiothreitol in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM) at pH 7.5. The enzyme was further purified after precipitating it by dialyzing out the KCl and then resolubilized with 0.8% octyl glucoside in 1 M KCl (plus NADPH and dithiothreitol).

Consistent with this, GPD and GPAT are highly induced during differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. While the acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (acyl-DHAP) pathway for glycerolipid synthesis is commonly believed to be involved only in glycerol ether lipid synthesis, we report here that during conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes, the specific activity of peroxisomal DHAP acyltransferase (DHAPAT) is increased by 9-fold in 6 days, while acyl-DHAP:NADPH reductase is induced by 5-fold. A parallel increase in the catalase (the peroxisomal marker enzyme) activity is also seen. In contrast, the specific activity of alkyl-DHAP synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of the ether bond, is decreased by 60% during the same period. Unlike microsomal GPAT, the induced DHAPAT is found to have high activity at pH 5.5 and is resistant to inhibition by sulfhydryl agents, heat, and proteolysis. On subcellular fractionation, DHAPAT is found to be associated with microperoxisomes whereas GPAT activity is mainly present in microsomes. Northern blot analyses reveal that induction of DHAPAT can be largely explained through increases in DHAPAT mRNA. A comparison of microsomal and peroxisomal glycerolipid synthetic pathways, using D-[3-(3)H, U-(14)C]glucose as the precursor of the lipid glycerol backbone shows that about 40-50% of triglyceride is synthesized via the acyl-DHAP pathway.

Judging from their Km and Vmax values, glycerol phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15), acyl/alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase (EC 1.1.1.101), and acyl coenzyme A reductase (long-chain alcohol forming), appear to be affected only slightly by the absence of peroxisomes characteristic of the Zellweger syndrome. Glycerophosphate acyltransferase also showed no differences in N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity nor in inhibition by dihydroxyacetone phosphate between these cell types. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.42) and alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.26) have altered activity and kinetic constants in homogenates from Zellweger syndrome fibroblasts. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase has similar Km (DHAP) values in both control and Zellweger syndrome cells; however, the value for the Vmax in Zellweger syndrome cells is only 6% of that found in the controls. This is interpreted as indicating that this enzyme is not defective in this disease but is simply present at a depressed level. Also, this enzyme activity has a maximum rate at pH 7.0-7.5 in the mutant cells as opposed to pH 5.4 in the controls. Acylation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate by control cell homogenate was stimulated by N-ethylmaleimide at both pH 5.7 and 7.5 whereas this activity from Zellweger syndrome cells was slightly inhibited at pH 5.7 and strongly inhibited at pH 7.5. In the absence of detergent, dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase in the Zellweger syndrome cells was much more labile to trypsin than in the control cells. Alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase had a slightly higher Km (33 vs 17 microM) for palmitoyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate and a lower Vmax (0.07 vs 0.24 mU/mg protein) in the Zellweger syndrome cells as compared to controls. Although this is a substantial decrease in activity, it probably contributes little to the decreased rate of ether lipid synthesis in these cells. The major problem in this respect is apparently the loss of dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase activity. All of these enzymes, in both control and Zellweger syndrome cell homogenates, are sedimentable by centrifugation at 100,000g.

One or more of the proteases employed (chymotrypsin, trypsin and pronase) inactivated each of the seven enzyme activities in intact microsomal vesicles. These two approaches indicate that each of these enzymes has important domains located on the cytoplasmic surface of microsomal vesicles. These enzyme activities could be assayed in intact microsomal vesicles. None appeared to be highly latent, indicating that substrates have free access to active sites. One substrate for each of these enzymes had been shown previously to be unable to cross the microsomal membrane. These data indicate that the active sites of these enzymes are located on the cytoplasmic surface of microsomal vesicles. It is concluded that the synthesis of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, intermediates of ether lipid formation and other intermediates of glycerolipid synthesis occur asymmetrically on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings and our previous investigations on the topography of seven enzymes of triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis (Ballas, L.M. and Bell, R.M., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 602, (1980) 578-590) indicate that the synthesis of the major cellular glycerolipids occurs asymmetrically on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum.","['acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'NADPH']","['1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate', 'NADP+']",['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O'],['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']

Studies with isolated subcellular fractions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that lipid particles and the endoplasmic reticulum harbor 1-acyldihydroxyacetone-phosphate reductase (ADR) activity. Deletion of the open reading frame YIL124w (in the following named AYR1) abolished reduction of 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate in lipid particles, whereas ADR activity in microsomes of the deletion strain was decreased approximately 3-fold as compared with the wild-type level. This result indicates that (i) both lipid particles and microsomes harbor Ayr1p, which was confirmed by immunological detection of the protein in these two cellular compartments, and (ii) microsomes contain at least one additional ADR activity. As a consequence of this redundancy, deletion of AYR1 neither results in an obvious growth phenotype nor affects the lipid composition of a haploid deletion strain. When a heterozygous AYR1(+)/ayr1(-) diploid strain was subjected to sporulation; however, spores bearing the ayr1 defect failed to germinate, suggesting that Ayr1p plays an essential role at this stage. Overexpression of Ayr1p at a 5- to 10-fold level of wild type caused growth arrest. Heterologous expression of Ayr1p in Escherichia coli resulted in gain of ADR activity in the prokaryote, confirming that YIL124w is the structural gene of the enzyme and does not encode a regulatory or auxiliary component required for reduction of 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate.

Both enzymes are also components of the endoplasmic reticulum, but this compartment contains additional acyltransferase(s) involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidic acid (K. Athenstaedt and G. Daum, J. Bacteriol. 179:7611-7616, 1997). Using the gat1 mutant strain TTA1, we show here that Gat1p present in both subcellular fractions accepts glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate as a substrate. Similarly, the additional acyltransferase(s) present in the endoplasmic reticulum can acylate both precursors. In contrast, yeast mitochondria harbor an enzyme(s) that significantly prefers dihydroxyacetone phosphate as a substrate for acylation, suggesting that at least one additional independent acyltransferase is present in this organelle. Surprisingly, enzymatic activity of 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase, which is required for the conversion of 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate to 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid), is detectable only in lipid particles and the endoplasmic reticulum and not in mitochondria. In vivo labeling of wild-type cells with [2-3H, U-14C]glycerol revealed that both glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be incorporated as a backbone of glycerolipids. In the gat1 mutant and the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase slc1 mutant, the dihydroxyacetone phosphate pathway of phosphatidic acid biosynthesis is slightly preferred as compared to the wild type. Thus, mutations of the major acyltransferases Gat1p and Slc1p lead to an increased contribution of mitochondrial acyltransferase(s) to glycerolipid synthesis due to their substrate preference for dihydroxyacetone phosphate.","['acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'NADPH']","['1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate', 'NADP+']",['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O'],['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']

Judging from their Km and Vmax values, glycerol phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15), acyl/alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase (EC 1.1.1.101), and acyl coenzyme A reductase (long-chain alcohol forming), appear to be affected only slightly by the absence of peroxisomes characteristic of the Zellweger syndrome. Glycerophosphate acyltransferase also showed no differences in N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity nor in inhibition by dihydroxyacetone phosphate between these cell types. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.42) and alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.26) have altered activity and kinetic constants in homogenates from Zellweger syndrome fibroblasts. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase has similar Km (DHAP) values in both control and Zellweger syndrome cells; however, the value for the Vmax in Zellweger syndrome cells is only 6% of that found in the controls. This is interpreted as indicating that this enzyme is not defective in this disease but is simply present at a depressed level. Also, this enzyme activity has a maximum rate at pH 7.0-7.5 in the mutant cells as opposed to pH 5.4 in the controls. Acylation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate by control cell homogenate was stimulated by N-ethylmaleimide at both pH 5.7 and 7.5 whereas this activity from Zellweger syndrome cells was slightly inhibited at pH 5.7 and strongly inhibited at pH 7.5. In the absence of detergent, dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase in the Zellweger syndrome cells was much more labile to trypsin than in the control cells. Alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase had a slightly higher Km (33 vs 17 microM) for palmitoyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate and a lower Vmax (0.07 vs 0.24 mU/mg protein) in the Zellweger syndrome cells as compared to controls. Although this is a substantial decrease in activity, it probably contributes little to the decreased rate of ether lipid synthesis in these cells. The major problem in this respect is apparently the loss of dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase activity. All of these enzymes, in both control and Zellweger syndrome cell homogenates, are sedimentable by centrifugation at 100,000g.

Consistent with this, GPD and GPAT are highly induced during differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. While the acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (acyl-DHAP) pathway for glycerolipid synthesis is commonly believed to be involved only in glycerol ether lipid synthesis, we report here that during conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes, the specific activity of peroxisomal DHAP acyltransferase (DHAPAT) is increased by 9-fold in 6 days, while acyl-DHAP:NADPH reductase is induced by 5-fold. A parallel increase in the catalase (the peroxisomal marker enzyme) activity is also seen. In contrast, the specific activity of alkyl-DHAP synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of the ether bond, is decreased by 60% during the same period. Unlike microsomal GPAT, the induced DHAPAT is found to have high activity at pH 5.5 and is resistant to inhibition by sulfhydryl agents, heat, and proteolysis. On subcellular fractionation, DHAPAT is found to be associated with microperoxisomes whereas GPAT activity is mainly present in microsomes. Northern blot analyses reveal that induction of DHAPAT can be largely explained through increases in DHAPAT mRNA. A comparison of microsomal and peroxisomal glycerolipid synthetic pathways, using D-[3-(3)H, U-(14)C]glucose as the precursor of the lipid glycerol backbone shows that about 40-50% of triglyceride is synthesized via the acyl-DHAP pathway.

Both enzymes are also components of the endoplasmic reticulum, but this compartment contains additional acyltransferase(s) involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidic acid (K. Athenstaedt and G. Daum, J. Bacteriol. 179:7611-7616, 1997). Using the gat1 mutant strain TTA1, we show here that Gat1p present in both subcellular fractions accepts glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate as a substrate. Similarly, the additional acyltransferase(s) present in the endoplasmic reticulum can acylate both precursors. In contrast, yeast mitochondria harbor an enzyme(s) that significantly prefers dihydroxyacetone phosphate as a substrate for acylation, suggesting that at least one additional independent acyltransferase is present in this organelle. Surprisingly, enzymatic activity of 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase, which is required for the conversion of 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate to 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid), is detectable only in lipid particles and the endoplasmic reticulum and not in mitochondria. In vivo labeling of wild-type cells with [2-3H, U-14C]glycerol revealed that both glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be incorporated as a backbone of glycerolipids. In the gat1 mutant and the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase slc1 mutant, the dihydroxyacetone phosphate pathway of phosphatidic acid biosynthesis is slightly preferred as compared to the wild type. Thus, mutations of the major acyltransferases Gat1p and Slc1p lead to an increased contribution of mitochondrial acyltransferase(s) to glycerolipid synthesis due to their substrate preference for dihydroxyacetone phosphate.","['acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'NADPH']","['1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate', 'NADP+']",['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O'],['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']

Studies with isolated subcellular fractions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that lipid particles and the endoplasmic reticulum harbor 1-acyldihydroxyacetone-phosphate reductase (ADR) activity. Deletion of the open reading frame YIL124w (in the following named AYR1) abolished reduction of 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate in lipid particles, whereas ADR activity in microsomes of the deletion strain was decreased approximately 3-fold as compared with the wild-type level. This result indicates that (i) both lipid particles and microsomes harbor Ayr1p, which was confirmed by immunological detection of the protein in these two cellular compartments, and (ii) microsomes contain at least one additional ADR activity. As a consequence of this redundancy, deletion of AYR1 neither results in an obvious growth phenotype nor affects the lipid composition of a haploid deletion strain. When a heterozygous AYR1(+)/ayr1(-) diploid strain was subjected to sporulation; however, spores bearing the ayr1 defect failed to germinate, suggesting that Ayr1p plays an essential role at this stage. Overexpression of Ayr1p at a 5- to 10-fold level of wild type caused growth arrest. Heterologous expression of Ayr1p in Escherichia coli resulted in gain of ADR activity in the prokaryote, confirming that YIL124w is the structural gene of the enzyme and does not encode a regulatory or auxiliary component required for reduction of 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate. Taken together, these results identified Ayr1p of the yeast as the first ADR from any organism at the molecular level.","['acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'NADPH']","['1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate', 'NADP+']",['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O'],['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']

To understand how phosphatidic acid biosynthesis is controlled in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we studied the regulation of three enzyme activities involved in the synthesis of this glycerolipid precursor, i.e., glycerophosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT), and acyl DHAP reductase. GPAT activity was increased 3-fold, while DHAPAT activity was increased up to 9-fold in wild type cells grown in a nonfermentable carbon source compared to that of glucose-grown cells. The ratio of GPAT/DHAPAT activity was 12 in glucose-grown cells but only 4 in cells grown in glycerol/ethanol. In the previously characterized tpa1 mutant, (T. S. Tillman and R. M. Bell. 1986. J. Biol. Chem. 261: 9144-9149), GPAT was decreased 2-fold and DHAPAT 27-fold compared to activities in the wild type. Acyl DHAP reductase activity in both wild type and tpa1 cells grown on a nonfermentable carbon source was increased approximately 2-fold over that of glucose-grown cells. All three enzymatic activities increased as wild type cells grown on glucose entered the stationary phase of growth. Therefore, GPAT, DHAPAT, and acyl DHAP reductase activities appear to be regulated by the respiratory state of the cell.

The seven enzyme activities investigated (dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase, acyldihydroxyacetone-phosphate oxidoreductase, phosphatidic acid : CTPcytidyltransferase, CDPdiacylglycerol : inositol phosphatidyltransferase, 2-monoacylglycerol acyltransferase, diacylglycerol kinase, and the serine base exchange enzyme) function in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine synthesis and at intermediate levels in glycerolipid synthesis including steps of ether lipid synthesis. Mercury-dextran inhibited four of these enzymes greater than 60% in intact microsomal vesicles. One or more of the proteases employed (chymotrypsin, trypsin and pronase) inactivated each of the seven enzyme activities in intact microsomal vesicles. These two approaches indicate that each of these enzymes has important domains located on the cytoplasmic surface of microsomal vesicles. These enzyme activities could be assayed in intact microsomal vesicles. None appeared to be highly latent, indicating that substrates have free access to active sites. One substrate for each of these enzymes had been shown previously to be unable to cross the microsomal membrane. These data indicate that the active sites of these enzymes are located on the cytoplasmic surface of microsomal vesicles. It is concluded that the synthesis of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, intermediates of ether lipid formation and other intermediates of glycerolipid synthesis occur asymmetrically on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings and our previous investigations on the topography of seven enzymes of triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis (Ballas, L.M. and Bell, R.M., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 602, (1980) 578-590) indicate that the synthesis of the major cellular glycerolipids occurs asymmetrically on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum.","['acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'NADPH']","['1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate', 'NADP+']",['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O'],['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']

The enzyme could be solubilized by detergents only at high ionic strengths in presence of the cosubstrate NADPH. Peroxisomes, isolated from liver by a Nycodenz step density gradient centrifugation, were first treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 to remove the soluble and a large fraction of the membrane-bound proteins. The enzyme was solubilized from the resulting residue by 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 M KCl, 0.3 mM NADPH, and 2 mM dithiothreitol in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM) at pH 7.5. The enzyme was further purified after precipitating it by dialyzing out the KCl and then resolubilized with 0.8% octyl glucoside in 1 M KCl (plus NADPH and dithiothreitol). The second solubilized enzyme was purified to homogeneity (370-fold from peroxisomes) by gel filtration in a Sepharose CL-6B column followed by affinity chromatography on an NADPH-agarose gel matrix. NADPH-agarose was prepared by reacting periodate-oxidized NADP+ to adipic acid dihydrazide-agarose and then reducing the immobilized NADP+ with NaBH4. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme showed a single homogeneous band with an apparent molecular weight of 60,000. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 75,000 by size exclusion chromatography. Amino acid analysis of the purified protein showed that hydrophobic amino acid comprised 27% of the molecule. The Km value of the purified enzyme for hexadecyldihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) was 21 microM, and the Vmax value in the presence of 0.07 mM NADPH was 67 mumol/min/mg. The turnover number (Kcat), after correcting for the isotope effect of the cosubstrate NADP3H, was calculated to be 6,000 mol/min/mol of enzyme, assuming the enzyme has a molecular weight of 60,000. The purified enzyme also used palmitoyldihydroxyactone phosphate as a substrate (Km = 15.4 microM, and Vmax = 75 mumol/min/mg). Palmitoyl-DHAP competitively inhibited the reduction of hexadecyl-DHAP, indicating that the same enzyme catalyzes the reduction of both acyl-DHAP and alkyl-DHAP. NADH can substitute for NADPH, but the Km of the enzyme for NADH (1.7 mM) is much higher than that for NADPH (20 microM). The purified enzyme is competitively (against NADPH) inhibited by NADP+ and palmitoyl-CoA. The enzyme is stable on storage at 4 degrees C in the presence of NADPH and dithiothreitol.","['alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate', 'NADPH', 'H+']","['1-alkyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate', 'NADP+']","['C1C=CN(C=C1C(=O)N)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O', '[H+]']",['C1=CC(=C[N+](=C1)[C@H]2[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O2)COP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OC[C@@H]3[C@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O3)N4C=NC5=C(N=CN=C54)N)OP(=O)(O)O)O)O)O)C(=O)N']
